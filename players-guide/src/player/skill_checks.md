# Ability Scores
Every player is provided with a Report Card page, which looks like this:

TODO::ART

#### Body:
* Strong - _Big muscle. Strong. Lift heavy._
* Fast - _Nimble. Quick._

#### Mind:
* Clever - _Quick-thinking._
* Wise - _Careful, thoughtful._

#### Heart:
* Lucky - _Things just work out more often for this player._
* Charming - _Charismatic. Magnetic._

A player must choose 2 Abilities from the set of 6: Strong, Fast, Clever, Wise, Lucky, or Charming.
Choose an ability by circling it on your character sheet.

These are the players' Chosen Abilities.

A player must also Cross Out 1 Ability from the set of 6.

This is the players' Weak Ability. Depending on the ability that's been crossed out, write the following next to it:

* Strong - Weak (Hits harder in combat)
* Fast - Slow (Dodges easier in combat)
* Clever - Dull (Gets to pick more skills)
* Wise - Foolish (More card recycle in combat)
* Lucky - Unlucky (Gets a better deck of cards)
* Charming - Repulsive

As an example, a player might be Strong and Clever, but not Lucky, or they might be Fast and Charming, but not Wise.

If a player is Lucky, remove the Two of Cups, the Two of Swords, the Two of Wands, and the Two of Pentacles from their deck.

If a player is Unlucky, remove the Fool from their deck.


## Skills

A player must choose 2 Skills.
They can _only_ choose skills if they have the associated Ability.
(For example: if you are not Charming or Fast, you cannot choose Deception, Theft & Stealth).
Choose a skill by circling it on your character sheet, then writing an "A+" next to it.

If a player is Clever, they can choose 3 Skills.
If a player is Dull, they can choose 1 Skill, and they can't choose any skill marked "Clever".

> The A+ is thematic, and you can use anything you want to indicate that this is a preferred skill:
a gold star sticker, a _unicorn sticker_, a "good work!", whatever floats your boat.

The chosen skills are the player's Chosen Skills.
Any Skill Check that the player performs against a Chosen Skill becomes easier
by one rank: an Impossible check becomes Hard, a Hard check becomes Medium, and so on.
(See "[Skill Checks](#skill-checks)" for more information on this.)

A player must Cross Out 2 skills. _Any_ check against a Crossed Out Skill becomes Impossible for the player.
Cross Out a skill by drawing a line through it, then writing "Fail" next to it.

(Strong + Lucky are underrepresented, here, because they provide significant bonuses outside of Skills)
(Clever + Wise are overrepresented here, because they're some of the weakest outside of Skills)

### Obsession

each kid has one Skill Obsession, something they're almost supernaturally good at/obsessed with
it must be attached to one of their existing skills - "Baseball" in "Movement, Sport & Dance", or
"Pokemon" in "Hacking & Computers".

## Skill Checks

### Determining the Skill for a Skill Check
TODO::FILLIN

### Determining the Difficulty of a Skill Check

* Automatic: Breathing. Walking.
* Trivial: Making toast.
* Easy: Most people could probably do this, most of the time.
* Medium: A trained person can probably do this, most of the time.
* Hard: A skilled adult with a lot of training might be able to do this.
* Unlikely:
* Impossible: Eating the moon. Performing major surgery with no training.

### Resolving a Skill Check
Skill checks are resolved by having the player draw the top card from their decks.

* Automatic: The player can not fail this check. You shouldn't have even made them draw a card.
* Trivial: Only fails on a Critical Failure.
* Easy: Success on any card >= 5, or any Major Arcana, otherwise fails
* Medium: Success on any card >= 10, or any Major Arcana, otherwise fails
* Hard: Success on any Major Arcana, otherwise fails
* Unlikely: Success on a Critical Success, otherwise fails
* Impossible: The player can not succeed at this check. You shouldn't have even made them draw a card.

If the card drawn is a Major Arcana - well, it might trigger a Critical Success or
Critical Failure.

### Success
Simple: whatever the player was trying to achieve? They succeeded. The thing happens.
The scene continues, the thing having happened.

### Failure
If the player fails a roll, the thing they were trying to achieve? It doesn't happen.

However, the player can negotiate with the GM to convert
their Failure into a Success At A Terrible Cost.

The GM can deny this request: No matter _what_ the player spends, they cannot climb
from the Moon to the Earth by simply rolling an Impossible check and converting their
Failure to a Success At A Terrible Cost.

### Success At A Terrible Cost.
(TODO: flesh this out)

### Sometimes There Are Consequences Either Way
Succeed at breaking down a heavy door? It's possible that the sound of this will
alert some guards! Life isn't always fair.

### Critical Success
Certain cards will trigger a Critical Success:

* A Fool is always a Critical Success
* The World is always a Critical Success
* Each Skill has an associated Major Arcana that always triggers a Critical Success
* The player's own Major Arcana card always triggers a Critical Success
* If the Wheel of Fortune is drawn, the player flips a coin: A Heads triggers a Critical Success.

On an Unlikely check, a Critical Success is just a success: nothing special happens, but
it was unlikely that the player would have succeeded, so that alone is special.

On other checks, a Critical Success indicates that something about the success was a little
bit _extra good_. The player, at the GM's discretion, should recieve some small extra bonus
or benefit for completing this task _perfectly_.

### Critical Failure
The Critical Success conditions fire _before_ the Critical Failure conditions.

Certain cards will trigger a Critical Failure:

* If a card is a Critical Success, it can't be a Critical Failure.
* A Tower is always a Critical Failure.
* Each Skill has an associated Major Arcana that always triggers a Critical Failure
* If the Wheel of Fortune is drawn, the player flips a coin: A Tails triggers a Critical Failure.

On a Trivial check, a Critical Failure is just a failure: nothing special happens, but
it was unlikely that the player would have failed, so that alone is special.

On other checks, a Critical Failure indicates that something about the failure was a little
bit _extra bad_. Something goes wrong with this failure.

### Happenstance
When a Critical Success or Critical Failure is triggered by The Fool or the Wheel of Fortune:
it should be made clear by the GM that, even within the fiction of the game, this success (or failure) was
powered by blind luck and happenstance, and not skill at all.

If, for example, the player draws The Fool during a Hacking check, maybe they just
find the password for the computer that they are hacking on a post-it note attached
to the computer - or guess the right password on their first try.

If the player draws The Fool while attempting major surgery (note that the difficulty
of attempting major surgery, as a teenager, is going to be Unlikely or Impossible),
maybe they accidentally drop a Junior Mint into the chest cavity of their patient,
which _should_ cause major complications but, in an unlikely twist of fate actually
kills what would otherwise have been a fatal infection.
