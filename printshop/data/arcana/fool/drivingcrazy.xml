* When Everyone Loves a Parade triggers, after Adversaries have redrawn their Intents, you may also:
   * Discard any of the newly drawn Intents.
   * An Adversary with a discarded Intent does not take an action this turn.
   * Take 1 Corruption Point for each discarded Intent after the first (which is a freebie).
