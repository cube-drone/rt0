* While you have a Concussion, you are `Foolish`.
* You can not use "Wise" skills.
* If you were already Foolish: now, you must use the Foolish ability twice per combat turn and you cannot Concentrate at all.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Wise, now you are Foolish).
* A successful AID (First Aid) check can downgrade this to Dizzy.
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.
