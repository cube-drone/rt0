# The Adventure

Lots of RPG systems are designed to tell _any_ story. They're broad, flexible systems that
you can spend loads of time telling tale after tale in.

That's not RT:0. RT:0 has just the one story: this one. You can change it as much as you
like while running it for your friends, but (at least at time of writing), RT:0 is an
adventure that just comes with _just the one campaign_.

## The Four Act Structure
The main storyline is divided into four acts.

### Act 1: Joyeuse, Introduction to Paradise Lua
In this act, players are introduced to Paradise Lua and allowed to roam Joyeuse Division.

#### Touchdown
* Players touch down in the [Passenger Concourse](./locations/joyeuse/airlock.md#passenger-concourse),
    along with enough NPC teenagers to count up to 8.
* Are the players met by a delegation? X0XI? Eddies?

#### Initiation
* Next, Daybreak Institute.
* The First Combat.
* Food and Sleep, The Stipend System
   * (players are given a stipend for expenses and lodging, but it was established decades ago and uncontrolled for inflation, so it's worthless)
   * (the Daybreak Institute dorms are unsuitable for human habitation, and the Cafeteria does not produce edible food)
* X0XI invites the player to get settled in and return the next day at 800 hours for their first lesson.
* Curfew? Players must be back in the dorms by 20:00, although the enforcement there is quite poor.

#### Quest 1: Players Need to Find Food and a Place to Sleep
* On account of having no money and no place to sleep, the players are going to need to figure out where they can sleep
* They aren't authorized to leave Joyeuse yet. This doesn't mean that they can't leave Joyeuse, merely that it's harder because they can't trivially get to the other sectors of

#### Curfew Problems
* It's impractical for players to check in to the dorms at 20:00 and stay there for the night.
* They either need to not show up for curfew (and face the Disciplinary Options) or fool the Curfew system somehow.

#### Disciplinary Options
* It's possible players will wake up and argue about whether or not they should go to the First Lesson.
* If the players are too busy getting into the weeds on Paradise Lua, that's fine: they miss the First Lesson.
* Curfew Problems and Skipping Class can both lead to Disciplinary Options
* Disciplinary Escalation:
 * A sternly worded note in the players' Disciplinary File
 * No access to the Dessert cart in the cafeteria (not actually meaningful, it doesn't work anyways)
 * Detention (Daybreak's Detention Hall is pretty trivial to escape)
 * Detention + A Hasty Security Patch over whatever method they used to escape last time (do this a few times)
 * Half-rations in the cafeteria.
 * The Paddle (A fight with a robot that makes everyone uncomfortable)
 * Invoking the Actual Executare (Criminal Charges)

#### The Lesson
* In order to effectively torture the players, the curricula is largely:
 * automated fight training
 * fights with other students
 * weird game show stuff
 * incredibly boring lesson plans
 * actually useful information
* Lessons do not last very long and the players are allowed the rest of the day to themselves

#### Quest 2: Assassination Plot?
* The Hermit finds the players.
* They enigmatically try to get the players to bump off The Chariot.

#### What's Really Happening, Here?
* X0XI is trying to manipulate the players into leaning in to their corruption powers by putting them under stress.
* X0XI is doing this because if the players' True Horrors form a strong enough psychic link,
   Judgement can crawl back up the link overtake the True Horrors themselves.
* The Hermit knows about this plan and is trying to sever links to the True Horrors by bumping off their Avatars


#### Act Break
* A "boss fight"
* The players get access to Krater Valley.

### Act 2: Krater, Things Seem Like They're Going Well

#### A Few Major and Minor Arcana Get Defeated By The Players
* Let the players explore a bit and get embroiled in their own nemeses.


### Act 3: Florin, Collapse
In this act, players gain access to the seat of Paradisa Lua's power, Florin,
just as the story hits its "darkest before the dawn".

* The Hanged Man reveals themselves and fully corrupts all of the other True Horrors.
* The Sun gets corrupted by The Hanged Man and the Sun itself _goes dark_, giving
   Paradise Lua maybe 48 hours on battery before it, too, goes dark.
* The Hanged Man is destroyed: Judgement is awakened.
* If The World wakes up, the universe itself will come to an end.


### Act 4: Nadir, Walk Backwards Into Hell, The Surface of the Moon
The final act.

Players start on the run and hopeless in a Paradise Lua that's much less hospitable
than even the horrible Paradise Lua from Act 1.

However: any of the hosts that they Saved in Acts 1, 2, and 3, they can shut down
their connection to their True Horrors, losing all powers but breaking The Hanged Man's
link to them, weakening Judgement.
