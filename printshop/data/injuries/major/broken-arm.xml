* While you have a Broken Arm, you are `Weak`.
* You can not use "Strong" skills.
* If you were already `Weak`: now, you cannot deal non-magical damage, at all.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Strong, now you are Weak).
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to a Splinted Arm Minor Injury.
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to the Massive, Painful Scar Minor Injury.
