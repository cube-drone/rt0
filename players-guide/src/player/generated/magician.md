[Magician Character Sheet](/generated/printables/magician.html)

## Description

A resourceful, powerful schemer, The Magician has brought a binder full of detailed plans
that has color-coded tabs for every possible situation and outcome. Sometimes magic is just
someone spending more time on something than anybody else might reasonably expect. They're always prepared,
and they always have a trick up their sleeve. The Magician gets access to more spells, and more damaging spells,
than any other Arcana.

* The Magician can treat The Fool card as a second The Magician card.
* The Magician gains the Clever ability.
* The Magician learns one extra spell at the start of the game.
* Choose two of the The Magician's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: This Was All Part of My Plan
Once per Day, The Magician can have planned ahead, retroactively.

#### Planned Ahead, Retroactively?
* This means that The Magician can declare that they had a plan in place for a situation that has just arisen, and that they have already taken steps to prepare for it.
* This can include lots of things: having a piece of vital equipment on hand, or having bribed someone in advance.
* The GM can veto or negotiate this.

## Arcana Abilities

### Rabbit Out of a Hat
_A trick isn't that impressive on it's own: line up a few more, and you've got a show._

* Place one card of each suit on Rabbit Out of a Hat
* Cards sitting on Rabbit Out of a Hat remain there.
* When all four cards are present:
   * Discard the lowest three cards
   * Draw the the highest ranked card into hand, and, for the rest of the turn, treat it as The Magician (for example, to trigger a spell).

### Saw in Half
_For the big finale, you're going to need a volunteer._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Saw in Half to Unlock it.**

* When Pull a Rabbit's effect triggers, you may choose to, instead:
   * Take 1 Corruption Point
   * Draw all four cards into hand, and, for the rest of the turn, treat **each** of them them as The Magician (for example, to trigger a spell).

### Abracadabra
_"I didn't know you knew that one!"  "Yeah, I didn't either."_

* Place a Magician on Abracadabra
* Choose a spell that nobody has learned. While there is a card on Abracadabra, you can use this spell as if you had learned it.
* Discard the Magician whenever you want.

### And For My Next Trick
_All of the knowledge in the world is at your fingertips, if you're willing to pay the price._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on And For My Next Trick to Unlock it.**

* When Abracadabra's effect triggers, you may choose to, instead:
   * Take 1 Corruption Point
   * While there is a card on Abracadabra, you can use _any_ spell as if you had learned it,
      even if you don't meet the card's requirements.

### Check Behind Your Ears
_"Where did you get that?"_

* Place any card of suit Pentacles on Check Behind Your Ears and discard it, immediately.

* The Adversary who is dealt damage by Check Behind Your Ears must redraw their Intent.
* Produce the numeric value of the card played on Check Behind Your Ears, in Credits, for the player, in the form of a credit chit.

### Miser's Dream
_A seemingly endless supply of wealth - of course, it's all an illusion._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Miser's Dream to Unlock it.**

* Any time a card is played on Check Behind Your Ears, you may draw a card.
* If the card drawn in this way is a Tower, take 1 Corruption Point and
    lose any credits generated by Check Behind Your Ears this combat.

### Cups and Balls
_No matter how hard they try to hit you, it seems like you're always one step ahead._

* Place the Page of Cups on Cups and Balls
* While a card is on Cups and Balls:
   * All of your cards now count as Cups, as well as their original suit.
   * This includes Major Arcana: A Death, for example, counts as a "13 of Cups".
* Discard the Page of Cups at will.

### Magic Wand
_"It's not the wand that's magic - the wand is nothing more than a prop to guide the eyes away from what's really happening.
    It's the magician who's magic."_

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Magic Wand to Unlock it.**

* Instead of playing a Page of Cups on Cups and Balls, you may play the Page of Wands:
   * While the Page of Wands is on Cups and Balls:
   * All cards now count as any suit, as well as counting as their original suit and value.

### Three Card Monte

* Place any card of suit Cups on Three Card Monte
* Discard two cards from hand, and draw three cards.
* Discard any cards on Three Card Monte at the end of the turn.

   * Take no damage for the remainder of the round.
