* Instead of placing it on Ballistics, you may instead place it on Astronomy and take 1 Corruption Point.
  * While there is a Wand on Astronomy, any Shield that you generate for yourself is instead generated for all Players.
  * So, if you generate 4 Shield, each Player (including yourself) gains 4 Shield this turn.
