**Intuition, Mystery, A Huge Number Two, Great BJ Game, Bringing Your Crescent Moon With You Wherever You Go**

Sitting between yin and yang, black and white, and two huge-ass pillars is The High Priestess.

A representative of the middle ground between two extremes, The High Priestess is the card of enby bisexual energy, but ultimately The High Priestess _did_ come to work dressed like a clitoris so take that with a grain of salt.

The interpretation of female anatomy as both sacred, mysterious, and utterly beyond the
realm of understanding does not speak well of mystic A.E. Waite's sexual prowess.

The iconography of the High Priestess card parallels that of the iconography on [The Hierophant](./5_the_hierophant.md).
