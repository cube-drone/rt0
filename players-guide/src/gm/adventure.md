# The Adventure

Lots of RPG systems are designed to tell _any_ story. They're broad, flexible systems that
you can spend loads of time telling tale after tale in.

That's not RT:0. RT:0 has just the one story: this one. You can change it as much as you
like while running it for your friends, but (at least at time of writing), RT:0 is an
adventure that just comes with _just the one campaign_.

## The Four Act Structure
The main storyline is divided into four acts.

### Act 1: Joyeuse, Introduction to Paradise Lua
In this act, players are introduced to Paradise Lua and allowed to roam Joyeuse Division.

#### Touchdown
* Players touch down in the [Passenger Concourse](./locations/joyeuse/airlock.md#passenger-concourse),
    along with enough NPC teenagers to count up to 8.
* Are the players met by a delegation? X0XI? Eddies?

#### Initiation
* Next, Daybreak Institute.
* The First Combat.
* Food and Sleep, The Stipend System
   * (players are given a stipend for expenses and lodging, but it was established decades ago and uncontrolled for inflation, so it's worthless)
   * (the Daybreak Institute dorms are unsuitable for human habitation, and the Cafeteria does not produce edible food)
* Maybe "The First Combat" and "The Dorms are Unsuitable for Human Habitation" are the same event?

#### Quest
* The introduction of the Magical MacGuffins: players must do X things to prevent the end of the world as we know it.

#### Act Break
* A "boss fight"
* The players get access to Krater Valley.

### Act 2: Krater, Things Get Worse


### Act 3: Florin, Collapse
In this act, players gain access to the seat of Paradisa Lua's power, Florin,
just as the government is collapsing in on itself.

### Act 4: Nadir, Walk Backwards Into Hell, The Surface of the Moon
The final act.
