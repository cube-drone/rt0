Some actions during battle call for Skill Checks. "I hack the computer while the battle is raging on", or "I force open the door".

Once the player has "paid" for the skill check, while keeping their hand and any current combat cards separate, the player shuffles their discard pile into their deck, then uses the deck to perform a skill check as usual.
