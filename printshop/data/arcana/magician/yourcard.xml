* When Three Card Monte's effect triggers:
  * If you guess the card correctly, instead of the normal effects:
  * Keep just the card you guessed correctly, adding it to your hand and treating it as a Magician.
  * Shuffle the other two cards back into your deck.
  * If you guess incorrectly, and any of the three cards are The Tower, take 1 Corruption Point.
