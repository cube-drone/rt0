* Place any Wand on Magic Wand.
* While a Wand is on Magic Wand:
   * All of your cards now count as Wands, as well as their original suit.
   * This includes Major Arcana: A Death, for example, counts as a "13 of Wands".
* Discard the card on Magic Wand at will.

"It's not the wand that's magic - the wand is nothing more than a prop to guide the eyes away from what's really happening.
    It's the magician who's magic."
