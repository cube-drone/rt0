A resourceful, powerful schemer, The Magician has brought a binder full of detailed plans
that has color-coded tabs for every possible situation and outcome. Sometimes magic is just
someone spending more time on something than anybody else might reasonably expect. They're always prepared,
and they always have a trick up their sleeve. The Magician gets access to more spells, and more damaging spells,
than any other Arcana.

### Skill: This Was All Part of My Plan
Once per Day, The Magician can have planned ahead, retroactively.

#### Planned Ahead, Retroactively?
* This means that The Magician can declare that they had a plan in place for a situation that has just arisen, and that they have already taken steps to prepare for it.
* This can include lots of things: having a piece of vital equipment on hand, or having bribed someone in advance.
* The GM can veto or negotiate this.
