* While you have Delerium, you are **Dull**.
* You can not use "Clever" skills.
* If you were already Dull: now, you cannot use any skills at all.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Clever, now you are Dull).
* A successful Hard AID (First Aid) check can downgrade this to Confusion.
* This check can be retried.
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.
* Take 4 Corruption Points to instantly heal Delerium.
