* In combat, when you draw any card (par example: The Tower), instead of doing what you had planned with that card, you may
    instead shuffle that card back into your deck without triggering any special effect associated with that card.
* Yes, you can use this to keep Catastrophe from triggering.
* Yes, you can use this to keep Surprise Twist from giving you Corruption points.
* No, you can not use this to turn a failed Skill Check into a "non-attempted" skill check.
