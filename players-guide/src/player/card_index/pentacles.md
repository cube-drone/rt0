# Pentacles
Pentacles are the suit of _wealth_.
This makes the cards some of the easiest to interpret: they are, in fact, all about the Benjamins.

## Ace of Pentacles - Payday
Gettin' _paid_. Fresh money opportunities.

## Two of Pentacles - Juggling
Juggling priorities, spinning plates.

## Three of Pentacles - Teamwork
Teamwork makes the dream work.

## Four of Pentacles - Saving
There isn't a lot to go around and the more you keep, the more you have.

## Five of Pentacles - Poverty
These children don't have rich parents, and therefore are trash, society's refuse.

## Six of Pentacles - Charity
Generosity greases the wheels. Today, you - tomorrow, me.

## Seven of Pentacles - Growth
With some perseverance you've made a big pile of food.
Nice.

## Eight of Pentacles - Industry
Repetition. Mastery. Production lines. Factories.

## Nine of Pentacles - Luxury
Luxury. Opulence. Marble columns. Very old wine.
Expensive birds.

## Ten of Pentacles - Inheritance
This isn't just wealth, it's _generational_ wealth, the kind of money
that doesn't just set you up, it sets up your whole family. Nobody will
ever have to work again. Somebody's got to do the repetitive labour,
but some of us just get to have that done on our behalf for our entire
lives, and that's mostly determined by how wealthy our parents were.

## Page of Pentacles - The Venture Capitalist
Basically it's the Ace of Pentacles again: New financial opportunities.
This one's a little more active, though: they've got money and a dream
 and are looking to get something profitable started.

## Knight of Pentacles - Discipline
It's the four and eight of Pentacles again:
Conservatism and financial discipline, but this time embodied by
_this guy_. He's not born to wealth, he's the hard-eyed middle manager
who's fought his way up from the warehouses. As a result, he's
sharp, unbelievably mercenary. The rich get to live in a soft, happy world
where nobody needs to get hurt, but _this guy_ fought his way in on a black
horse and some people had to get trampled on the way up the ladder.

## Queen of Pentacles - The Martha Stewart / Ina Garten / Gwyneth Paltrow Triangle
This woman has taken an picture, cutting lemons, in a perfectly white kitchen
with the beach barely visible in the window.

This carefully groomed image of pastoral simplicity doesn't reveal that the kitchen
was staged, that every decision in this shot was carefully directed, that the image
presented was worked over by a creative team to perfectly embody "pastoral simplicity".

This woman is the face of a business empire, selling the idea of perfect femininity.

## King of Pentacles - The Failson
His father made the empire, he just... inherited it. He has all of the power and prosperity
of a vast empire, but mostly blows it on cocaine and bad ideas. He imagines himself
a titan of industry, but most of what he provides is bluster.

However, the cruel hardass that built this empire still looms large in the failson's head and his heart -
but the _failson's cruelty_ is cargo cult evil, just being nasty because he thinks that's what his
father would do. Lacking the wisdom to know when it's truly time to unsheathe his dagger, his
betrayals are random and capricious.
