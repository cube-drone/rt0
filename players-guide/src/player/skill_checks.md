# Skills

Each player starts with a [Report Card](/generated/printables/reportcard.html),
which
is where we define player [Abilities](./abilities.md) and [Skills](./skill_checks.md).

Skills are on the right side of the Report Card.

## Choose a Skill

A player must choose 1 Skill:

* FINAID - Empathy, Perception & Danger Sense (_Fast / Lucky_)
* ART - Performance, Disguise & Forgery (_Charming / Fast_)
* SCI - Computers, Chemistry, Biology, Physics & Math (_Clever / Charming_)
* FREE - Stealth, Breaking & Entering (_Clever / Fast_)
* GYM - Movement, Sport & Dance (_Strong / Fast_)
* AID - First Aid, Exploration & Survival (_Wise / Charming_)
* SHOP - Mechanical, Constructive, & Culinary (_Wise / Strong_)
* LAW - Bureaucracy, Legal, and Investigative (_Wise / Clever_)
* MISC - Everything Not Otherwise Covered (_Lucky / Strong_)

They can _only_ choose a Skill if they have at least one of the associated Abilities:
For example: if you are not Charming or Fast, you cannot choose Deception, Theft & Stealth.

Choose a skill by writing an "A+" next to it.

> The A+ is thematic, and you can use anything you want to indicate that this is a preferred skill:
circle it, use a gold star sticker, a _unicorn sticker_, a "good work!", whatever floats your boat.

Any [Skill Check](#skill-checks) that the player performs against a Skill that they have chosen becomes
[easier by one rank](#determining-the-difficulty-of-a-skill-check):
an Impossible check becomes Hard, a Hard check becomes Medium, and so on.

## Fail a Skill

A player must fail 1 skill.
Fail a skill by writing an "F" next to it.

> The F is thematic, and you can use anything you want to indicate that this is a crossed out skill:
cross it out, write "SEE ME AFTER CLASS", put a sad-face sticker on it...

The player is _bad_ at this skill and won't generally be able to pass skill checks where it is involved.

_Any_ skill check against a failed Skill becomes [Unlikely](#determining-the-difficulty-of-a-skill-check) for the player.

## Skill Corruption

Players can mark Corruption Points on the "Skill Corruption" box on their Report Card. When all three of the _Corruption Circles_ are filled, you may gain a new Skill, and fail a new skill.

## Skill Checks

### Determining the Skill for a Skill Check
What is the task the player is hoping to perform, and under which skill does it fit?

Here are some examples of tasks that might fit under each category:

#### FINAID - Empathy, Perception & Danger Sense
* Determining if someone is lying to you.
* Searching a room for traps.
* Noticing something bad about to happen to you.
* Helping someone work through an emotional issue.

#### ART - Performance, Disguise & Forgery
* Disguising yourself as someone else.
* Performing in a musical.
* Forging a note.
* Painting.
* Knowing stuff about pop culture and art history.

#### SCI - Computers, Chemistry, Biology, Physics & Math
* Hacking into a computer to gain some secrets.
* An incredible bank shot in pool.
* Picking out the drugs least likely to harm you while robbing a pharmacy.
* Guessing valuable information about non-human Adversaries.

#### FREE - Stealth, Breaking & Entering
* Picking a lock.
* Doing things without drawing attention or while remaining hidden.
* Knowing stuff about security systems.

#### GYM - Movement, Sport & Dance
* Climbing a wall.
* Forcing through a door.
* Swimming, holding one's breath for a long time.
* Executing the legendary and forbidden "Chaos Dunk"
* Doing "The Angle Brackets", the dance craze sweeping Paradise Lua

* Turning something inedible (raw flour) into food.

#### LAW - Bureaucracy, Legal, & Investigative
* Searching a room for clues or useful items.
* Getting tech support to help with an issue.
* Checks against individuals who are bureaucratically "locked"
  * For example of bureaucratic lock: A cashier can't help you with your problem, _unless_ you can convince them that they can do so without losing their job.

#### MISC - Everything Else
* It doesn't fit into the above categories
* ???

### Wait, there's no "deception" or "communication" skill! How do I talk to people?
You have to actually talk to them.

### Determining the Difficulty of a Skill Check

* **Automatic**: Breathing. Walking. (The GM probably should not be calling for Automatic skill checks.)
* **Trivial**: Making toast.
* **Easy**: Most people could probably do this, most of the time.
* **Medium**: A trained person can probably do this, most of the time.
* **Hard**: A skilled adult with a lot of training might be able to do this.
* **Unlikely**: A world-class sniper making a once-in-a-lifetime shot, over a kilometer away.
* **Impossible**: Eating the moon. Jumping into space.

### Resolving a Skill Check
Skill checks are resolved by having the player draw the top card from their decks.

* **Automatic**: The player can not fail this check.
* **Trivial**: Only fails on a [Critical Failure](#critical-failure).
* **Easy**: Fails on any Minor Arcana <= 5, otherwise succeeds.
* **Medium**: Fails on any Minor Arcana <= 9, otherwise succeeds.
* **Hard**: Fails on any Minor Arcana, otherwise succeeds.
* **Unlikely**: Success on a [Critical Success](#critical-success), otherwise fails
* **Impossible**: The player can not succeed at this check.

If the card drawn is a Major Arcana - well, it might trigger a Critical Success or
Critical Failure.

### Success
Simple: whatever the player was trying to achieve? They succeeded. The thing happens.
The scene continues, the thing having happened.

### Failure
If the player fails a roll, the thing they were trying to achieve?

It either:
* doesn't happen (the door they were trying to open stays shut),
* it happens _but_ introduces significant additional complication for the players (the door opens, alerting the guards), or
* it doesn't happen _and_ introduces significant additional complication for the players (the door stays shut, alerting the guards).

The player can take 1 Corruption Point to retry the check.

Each time the player attempts to re-try the check, it becomes one step easier: an
Unlikely check becomes merely Hard, a Hard check becomes Medium, etc.

At the GM's discretion, a check can remain at its current difficulty level during a retry:
jumping from the Moon to the Earth is **Impossible** and no matter how many times a player tries
to accomplish it, it will remain **Impossible**.

### Sometimes There Are Consequences Either Way
Succeed at breaking down a heavy door? It's possible that the sound of this will
alert some guards! Life isn't always fair.

### Critical Success
Certain cards will trigger a Critical Success:

* A Fool is always a Critical Success
* The World is always a Critical Success
* The Sun is always a Critical Success
* The player's own Major Arcana card always triggers a Critical Success

On an Unlikely check, a Critical Success is just a success: nothing special happens, but
it was unlikely that the player would have succeeded, so that alone is special.

On other checks, a Critical Success indicates that something about the success was a little
bit _extra good_. The player, at the GM's discretion, should recieve some small extra bonus
or benefit for completing this task _perfectly_.

### Critical Failure
The Critical Success conditions fire _before_ the Critical Failure conditions.

Certain cards will trigger a Critical Failure:

* If a card is a Critical Success, it can't be a Critical Failure.
* A Tower is always a Critical Failure.
* The Devil is always a Critical Failure.
* Death is always a Critical Failure.

A Critical Failure indicates that something about the failure was a little
bit _extra bad_. Whatever the consequences are for failure, really lean into them a little bit.

### The Wheel of Fortune

When a Wheel of Fortune is drawn, the player will either see a Critical Success or Critical Failure.

Draw a second card:

* If the card is an Ace through a Nine: Critical Failure
* If the card is a 10, Page, Knight, Queen, King, or Major Arcana: Critical Success

### That Seems Like a Lot of Rules

Look, the middle of the [Report Card](/generated/printables/reportcard.html) lays it out pretty simply:
draw a card, see what happens.

### Inconsequential Skill Checks

In general, the GM should not be calling for skill checks unless there is something at stake.

Sometimes the player will request to perform an action that turns out to have no real stakes:
this check is Inconsequential.

Inconsequential is not the same as Automatic or Trivial:
"Breathing" and "walking" are automatic, whereas
"hacking into a computer that doesn't have any useful secrets on it"
is Hard but Inconsequential.

Depending on how generous the GM is feeling towards the players, if the players seem like they are
going to spend a lot of time or resources on a check that turns out to be Inconsequential, the GM can
warn them that this is going to be the case: the check, pass or fail, is unlikely to have a real
effect on the story. They can even skip the check itself and grant automatic failure or success.

"You quickly and successfully search the empty room. There is nothing here. It is an empty room."

### Bonus / Penalty
If the player has a significant, concrete _advantage_ on a skill check - for example,
deciphering a lab result when they have recently aced a chemistry course covering that
exact topic, they get a "Bonus" on that check. While they have Bonus,
they draw two cards and use whichever of the two cards they would prefer.

If the player has a significant, concrete _disadvantage_ on a skill check - for example,
climbing a wall with a [Splinted Leg](./injuries.md), they get a "Penalty" on that check. While they have Penalty,
they draw two cards and use whichever card the GM decides is the worse of the two.

Bonus and Penalty cancel one another out, and do not stack.

### No Retries
Unless otherwise specified, Skill Checks for a specific _thing_ cannot be made more than once per Day.
If you fail a skill check, it stays failed. Try to unlock a door and fail at it? You can't go back and
try again (until a Day has passed).

On top of that, a Skill Check can only be attempted by _one_ player. Another player can help (see: One Player Helps Another, below),
but only one player gets to _make_ the skill check, and once the card is drawn, the results are final.

However, if the player is in a low-stakes situation where they can take as many tries as they want,
the GM can make the check _itself_ easier.

### Interpreting Success and Failure

If the player needed a face card or Major Arcana to succeed, and they drew a 9, or a 10, that's a
closer failure than if they had drawn a 1 or a 2. If they needed to draw a Major Arcana and they draw a Magician (2),
that's a closer success than if they had drawn a Judgement (20).

The GM is free to interpret "close successes" or "close failures" as the player narrowly succeeding
or failing, if they want. They also _don't have to_, if it doesn't make sense for the check.

If the GM is able to, they're also encouraged to tie the drawn Tarot card's meaning to the result in some way.

For example:
* if the player draws a Chariot and succeeds, outline that the task was difficult but it was possible
thanks to help from the player's allies.
* If they draw a Magician and succeed, then the task was technically difficult
but possible thanks to the player's skill and perserverance.
* If they draw a Seven of Swords, and fail, it was because
they got too greedy and snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.
* If they draw a Nine of Swords, and fail,
it was because they panicked.

### Happenstance
When a Critical Success or Critical Failure is triggered by The Fool or the Wheel of Fortune:
it should be made clear by the GM that, even within the fiction of the game, this success (or failure) was
powered by blind luck and happenstance, and not skill at all.

If, for example, the player draws The Fool during a Hacking check, maybe they just
find the password for the computer that they are hacking on a post-it note attached
to the computer - or guess the right password on their first try.

If the player draws The Fool while attempting major surgery (note that the difficulty
of attempting major surgery, as a teenager, is going to be Unlikely or Impossible),
maybe they accidentally drop a Junior Mint into the chest cavity of their patient,
which _should_ cause major complications but, in an unlikely twist of fate actually
[kills what would otherwise have been a fatal infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Junior_Mint).

### Multiple Players Making a Skill Check Together
Let's imagine that every player is about to search a room, or every player is about to try
to stealth into a facility, or every player is pulling on a lever to try and move it.

This is a "everybody making a skill check together" moment.

#### Only One Player Needs to Succeed ("Searching a Room")
If this is the case, than whichever player draws the highest card succeeds "the most" and is the player
who actually accomplishes the task at hand. If no player succeeds, the whole task fails.

#### Every Player Needs to Succeed ("Sneaking Past Some Executare")

When doing a check like this, only _two_ players need to succeed at the check.
If any player gets a Critical Success, they succeed for everyone.
If any player gets a Critical Failure, they fail for everyone.

#### One Player Helps Another ("Pulling a Lever")

If the helping player can make an argument for how, exactly, they're helping
("I'll distract the shopkeeper while Marieta robs him blind!"), and they succeed at whatever
they're doing, grant the player making the check [Bonus](#bonus--penalty).

If they fail at whatever they're doing to help, grant the player making the check [Penalty](#bonus--penalty).
