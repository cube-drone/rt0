# 2 - The High Priestess

[High Priestess Character Sheet](/generated/printables/priestess.html)

## Description

Duality, prophecy, mystery, and the subconscious drive this enigmatic figure, who deals psychic damage and can literally see the future.
Blessed with visions and insight, but cryptic, odd, and quiet, the High Priestess can be difficult for their companions to
understand, but their actions always become clear - eventually.

* The High Priestess can treat The Fool card as a High Priestess.
* The High Priestess gains the Wise ability.
* The High Priestess only draws 3, rather than 5 cards per combat turn.
* At the beginning of every combat turn,
    the High Priestess may look at the top two cards of their deck and may draw either, none, or both of them.
* Choose two of The High Priestess's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: Foresight

* The High Priestess has packed a wide variety of divinatory tools that - unlike for most - actually **work**.
   * Their Magic 8-Ball is surprisingly accurate.
   * Their Ouija Board can actually be used to communicate with spirits, if they're present.
   * Their Tarot Deck can be used to draw a card that actually represents details about their present or future situation.
   * Their Crystal Ball can show them limited visions of things happening around them or visions of the future.
   * They've a handful of Fortune Cookies which contain actual, useful situation-appropriate advice.
* In general, the High Priestess can use these tools to gain insight into the future, or to understand the present,
    but after using any individual tool, it is exhausted for the Day.
* The High Priestess can either request that the GM provide a result, or, they can
    provide their own result and ask the GM to make it come true.
* If the GM can't or won't (sometimes it's just not going to happen): the item is not exhausted for the Day.

## Arcana Abilities

### All Signs Point to Yes
_It almost seems like you're in a trance._

* Place the High Priestess on All Signs Point to Yes
* While the High Priestess is on All Signs Point to Yes, Aces, Twos, Threes, and Nines can be used on Concentrate.
* Discard the High Priestess from All Signs Point to Yes whenever you like.
* When the High Priestess is discarded from All Signs Point to Yes, deal 1 Magic Ranged Damage to every Adversary.

### Better Not Tell You Now
_Changing minds. Breaking minds._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Better Not Tell You Now to Unlock it.**

* When the High Priestess is placed on All Signs Point To Yes, you may also take 1 Corruption Point
* If you do, while the High Priestess is on All Signs Point To Yes:
   * All Adversaries play their Intents face up, even if they would normally be hidden.
   * When an Adversary draws an Intent, instead they draw two: the High Priestess chooses which one they keep.
   * When the High Priestess is discarded from Better Not Tell You Now, deal 3 additional Magic Ranged Damage to every Adversary.

### YES NO
_Their eyes are wide with anticipation. Their third eye is wide with malice._

* Place the High Priestess on YES NO
* Look at the top five cards of your deck.
* Place any of them that you choose, shuffled, at the bottom of your deck.
* Place the rest on top of your deck in any order.
* Draw three cards.
* Discard the High Priestess from YES NO at the end of your turn.

### GOOD BYE
_The visions aren't always contained: sometimes they spill out, causing a mass hallucination._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on GOOD BYE to Unlock it.**

* When the High Priestess is placed on YES NO, you may also:
   * Take 1 Corruption Point
   * After drawing the top five cards of your deck, but before you place the rest of the cards on top of your deck,
        you may choose to place The High Priestess on top of your deck.
   * (_So, just to be clear, the order there is "the cards in the order you chose" "the High Priestess" "the rest of the cards" "the cards you placed at the bottom of your deck"_)
   * Every other player may also perform the action of YES NO.

### Origami Folding
_"They're just standing there, playing with a little piece of paper."_

* Instead of discarding cards from Concentrate, place them on Origami Folding.
* When there are 8 cards on Origami Folding, you may either:
    * Look at the top card of the deck and decide whether or not to draw it OR
    * Look at the top five cards of the deck, place any number of them on the bottom of the deck, then return them to the top of the deck in any order OR
    * Deal 2 Magic Damage to all Adversaries in your Zone.
* Then, discard all cards from Origami Folding.

### Rolling Bones
_"Let's see what the future holds. Oh... it's bad. It's really bad. You should probably run."_

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Rolling Bones to Unlock it.**

* Origami Folding now triggers when there are 6 cards, rather than 8.
* Do not discard cards from Origami Folding when it triggers.
* When there are 18 cards on Rolling Bones:
   * Gain 1 Corruption Point.
   * Discard all cards from Rolling Bones.
   * Deal 18 Magic Damage.

### Lucky Numbers: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
_If you can predict the future, every number is lucky._

* At the start of combat, draw a card from your deck and place it face-up on Lucky Numbers.
* If that card is The Tower, instead shuffle it back into your deck and replace it with a new card.
* Place a a 3, a 4, a 5, a 6, a 7, or an 8 on Lucky Numbers.
* Cards placed on Lucky Numbers remain at the end of the turn.
* Once you've placed a numbered card on Lucky Numbers, you can't place that number again until all numbers have been placed.
* When seven cards are on Lucky Numbers:
   * Return all cards on Lucky Numbers to your hand.
   * Draw a new card from your deck and place it face-up on Lucky Numbers.
   * You can not do this more than once per combat turn.

Remember that Major Arcana have numerical values, too: you could play a 4 of Cups and a V: The Hierophant, for example.

### A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected
_Every loose object in the room whirling around you like celestial bodies, and you are the Sun._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected to Unlock it.**

* Play any five-card straight on A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected.
* These cards must all be played at the same time.
    * Sum the cards's values: deal half that much Magic Damage, rounded down, to all Adversaries in your Zone.
    * Discard all cards on A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected.
    * If the five cards are not all in the same suit, take 1 Corruption Point and deal 1HP of Magic Damage to yourself and any allies in your Zone.
    * If the five cards are all Major Arcana, deal full Magic Damage rather than half.

* Just to clarify, a five-card straight is five cards in strict numerical order, like "2, 3, 4, 5, 6" or "10, Page, Knight, Queen, King".
* A straight can also be made out of the Major Arcana, but only if they are in strict numerical order.
* Wrap-around is not allowed, so "King, Ace, 2, 3, 4" is not a straight.

### Palm Reading
_The trick with palm reading is to strike others with your palms and then read their faces._

* If you are Strong, every time you draw a card, if it is a Sword, deal 1 Damage.
* If you are Fast, every time you draw a card, if it is a Cup, generate 1 Shield.
* If you are Lucky, every time you draw a card, if it is a King or Queen, draw another card.
* If you are Charming, every time you draw a card, if it is a Page or Knight, choose one ally: that ally regains 1HP.
* If you are Clever, every time you draw a card, if it is a Wand, deal 1 Ranged Magic Damage.

### Cold Reading
_"Your lifeline is short. Very short."_

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Cold Reading to Unlock it.**

* You may play a card on Cold Reading at any time during your turn: when you do:
   * Choose two of Strong, Fast, Lucky, Charming, and Clever:
   * Palm Reading acts as if you **also** had these traits.
   * However, if you draw The Tower or The Moon, take 1 Corruption Point.
* You may discard the card on Cold Reading at any time. This cancels the above effect.

As a small extra clarification, players might attempt to lawyer the order of turn operations
such that drawing The Tower or The Moon
with Cold Reading active
would not cause the Corruption Point to be taken. ("well, if The Tower discards the card from Cold Reading automatically...")
This is some Magic: The Gathering level bullshit and is not the intent of the card. If you draw The Tower or The Moon, you take
the Corruption Point.

### Ballistics
_Any object, sufficiently accelerated, can become a deadly weapon._

* Place any Wand on Ballistics
* While there is a Wand on Ballistics, all of your Damage and Magic Damage becomes Ranged Magic Damage.
* If an effect would target all Adversaries in the same Zone, it now targets all Adversaries.
* Discard the card on Ballistics at the end of your turn.

### Astronomy
_Move so fast that the world seems to stop._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Astronomy to Unlock it.**

* Play The World and The Moon on Astronomy.
* These cards must be played at the same time.
* Take 1 Corruption Point.
* At the end of this turn, take another turn.
* Discard all cards on Astronomy.
