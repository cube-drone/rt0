# Injuries, Healing, and Death

When players take HP damage in combat, they recover it as soon as the combat is resolved:
they might be scraped up but this is accounted for in the player's natural resilience.

However, if players hit 0HP, they immediately take a Major Injury of the GM's choice,
at which point they recover 15HP.

Some Adversaries can give the players injuries _directly_, as well as certain failed skill checks:
one might fail at preparing raw meat and end up with *Upset Stomach / Farts Ahoy!*.


## Minor

### Distracted
* A Distracted player must immediately discard all Wands or Pentacles drawn on their turn.
* Discard Distracted after Combat.

* While you have Upset Stomach / Farts Ahoy!, take a Penalty on all skill checks.
* Discard Farts Ahoy! at the end of the day.

### Groggy

   * Knights count as Critical Fails if drawn during skill checks.
   * If you draw a Knight during combat, immediately discard it.
* Discard Groggy when you have a restful sleep.

### Massive, Painful Scar
* It might be a physical or emotional scar, but either way it isn't going anywhere.
* You can have more than one Massive, Painful Scar.
* At the beginning of the day, cover one of your combat abilities with Massive, Painful Scar. It can not be used this day.
* A different combat ability can be chosen each day, but Massive, Painful Scar must always cover at least one ability.
* Two Massive, Painful Scars cannot cover the same ability.

## Major
If a player receives a second Major injury while they already have a Major Injury, instead give them
a Critical Injury.

## Critical Injury
If a player receives a second Critical injury while they already have a Critical Injury: they die.

## Using Corruption Points to Heal Injuries

At any time players can mark Corruption Points on their sheets to heal injuries:

* For 2 Corruption Points, a Minor Injury can vanish entirely.
* For 4 Corruption Points, a Major Injury can vanish entirely.
* For 6 Corruption Points, a Critical Injury can vanish entirely.

## Death

Death is entirely optional! Players can, of course, always take more corruption to avoid this unfortunate result.

The exact rules for player death are, unfortunately, only available to the GM.

Be assured, however, that this player character will no longer remain playable.

The amount of corruption the player has taken on _will_ be factored in.

## Full Corruption

Again, exactly what happens when there are no Corruption spaces left to fill on the character sheet remains a mystery,
for now (GM: It's explained in the GM's guide!), but presume that going far enough down this path will end up at a point where the character becomes no longer playable.

## Eddy, and Creating a New Player Character

If a player doesn't have access to a playable character for one reason or another
(Death, Full Corruption, heck, even simple unconsciousness or being trapped in a room somewhere), they can grab
 an [Eddy](./arcana/eddy.md). Eddy is a low-impact temporary player character designed for just such an occasion!

 If the player would like to continue, with a new Player Character, they must choose a new Major Arcana.

 A pod containing their player is _shot on to the moon_. If a NPC matching their arcana exists, that NPC is fated
 to die within the fortnight.
