    <skillDescription>
* Use Cancer to spawn a small, hard, magical force-field around you while exploring Paradise Lua, once per Day
* The bubble lasts for 30 minutes, and holds enough air for all 30 of those minutes.
* If fall damage were a problem (on the Moon, where gravity is not so harsh a mistress), the bubble would protect you from that, too.
