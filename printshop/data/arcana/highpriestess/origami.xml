* Instead of discarding cards from Concentrate, place them on Origami Folding.
* When there are 5 cards on Origami Folding, you may:
   * Deal 1 Magic Damage to all Adversaries in your Zone AND
   * Force 1 Adversary in your Zone to redraw their Intent
* Then, discard all cards from Origami Folding.
