# 2 - The High Priestess

[High Priestess Character Sheet](/generated/printables/priestess.html)

## Description

Duality, prophecy, mystery, and the subconscious drive this enigmatic figure, who deals psychic damage and can literally see the future.
Blessed with visions and insight, but cryptic, odd, and quiet, the High Priestess can be difficult for their companions to
understand, but their actions always become clear - eventually.

* The High Priestess can treat The Fool card as a High Priestess.
* The High Priestess gains the Wise ability.
* The High Priestess only draws 3, rather than 5 cards per combat turn.
* At the beginning of every combat turn,
    the High Priestess may look at the top two cards of their deck and may draw either, none, or both of them.
* Choose two of The High Priestess's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: Foresight

* The High Priestess has packed a wide variety of divinatory tools that - unlike for most - actually **work**.
   * Their Magic 8-Ball is surprisingly accurate.
   * Their Ouija Board can actually be used to communicate with spirits, if they're present.
   * Their Tarot Deck can be used to draw a card that actually represents details about their present or future situation.
   * Their Crystal Ball can show them limited visions of things happening around them or visions of the future.
   * They've a handful of Fortune Cookies which contain actual, useful situation-appropriate advice.
* In general, the High Priestess can use these tools to gain insight into the future, or to understand the present,
    but after using any individual tool, it is exhausted for the Day.
* The High Priestess can either request that the GM provide a result, or, they can
    provide their own result and ask the GM to make it come true.
* If the GM can't or won't (sometimes it's just not going to happen): the item is not exhausted for the Day.

## Arcana Abilities

### All Signs Point to Yes
_It almost seems like you're in a trance._

_Corruption Upgrade: Better Not Tell You Now_

* While the High Priestess is on All Signs Point to Yes:
   * Twos, Threes, Fours, and Nines can be used on Concentrate.
   * When a Two, Three, Four, or Nine is used on Concentrate, instead of discarding it, place it
      on All Signs Point to Yes.
* Discard the High Priestess from All Signs Point to Yes whenever you like.
   * When the High Priestess is discarded from All Signs Point to Yes (even by The Tower),

   * When an Adversary draws an Intent, instead they draw two: the High Priestess chooses which one they keep.
   * When the High Priestess is discarded from Better Not Tell You Now, deal 3 additional Magic Ranged Damage to every Adversary.

### YES NO
_Their eyes are wide with anticipation. Their third eye is wide with malice._

_Corruption Upgrade: GOOD BYE_

  * Place any of them that you choose, shuffled, at the bottom of your deck.

  * Draw three cards.
* Draw an Intent for each Adversary: this is their Intent for the turn after this one.

### GOOD BYE
_The visions aren't always contained: sometimes they spill out, causing a mass hallucination._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on GOOD BYE to Unlock it.**

* When the High Priestess is placed on YES NO, you may also:
   * Take 1 Corruption Point
   * After drawing the top five cards of your deck, but before you place the rest of the cards on top of your deck,
        you may choose to place The High Priestess on top of your deck.
   * (_So, just to be clear, the order there is "the cards in the order you chose" "the High Priestess" "the rest of the cards" "the cards you placed at the bottom of your deck"_)
   * Every other player may also perform the action of YES NO.

### Origami Folding
_"They're just standing there, playing with a little piece of paper."_

_Corruption Upgrade: Rolling Bones_

* When there are 5 cards on Origami Folding, you may:
   * Deal 1 Magic Damage to all Adversaries in your Zone AND
   * Force 1 Adversary in your Zone to redraw their Intent

_If you can predict the future, every number is lucky._

_Corruption Upgrade: A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected_

* Any time a 7 is drawn, immediately gain 4 Shield.
* Place a a 3, a 4, a 5, a 6, a 7, or an 8 on Lucky Numbers.
* Once you've placed a numbered card on Lucky Numbers, you can't place that number again until all numbers have been placed.
* When all six cards are on Lucky Numbers:
   * Return all cards on Lucky Numbers to your hand.
   * These count as card draws and trigger any effects that would trigger on a card draw.
   * You can not do this more than once per combat turn.

Remember that Major Arcana have numerical values, too: you could play a 4 of Cups and a V: The Hierophant, for example.

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected to Unlock it.**

* Take 2 Corruption Points to activate A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected.

   * If it is a 5, draw another card
   * If it is a King, do 1 Damage
   * If it is a Queen, gain 1 Shield

* If an effect would target all Adversaries in the same Zone, it now targets all Adversaries.
* Discard the card on Ballistics at the end of your turn.

### Astronomy
_Move so fast that the world seems to stop._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Astronomy to Unlock it.**

* Instead of placing it on Ballistics, you may instead place it on Astronomy and take 1 Corruption Point.
  * While there is a Wand on Astronomy, any Shield that you generate for yourself is instead generated for all Players.
