[Fool Character Sheet](/generated/printables/fool.html)

## Description

Lucky, reckless, unreliable, and full of surprises, The Fool is a bit of a wildcard, a bit of a class clown, but
when the chips are down, they're definitely... something.

* The Fool can treat The Fool card as a true wildcard: any card they choose, in any situation.
* The Fool gains the Lucky ability.
* Choose two of The Fool's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: Deus Ex Machina
Once per Day, The Fool can request a Deus Ex Machina from the GM: The universe itself intervenes to provide a hint,
happy accident, fortuitous coincidence, or other stroke of unexpected luck.

## Arcana Abilities
