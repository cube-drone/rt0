# Basic Mechanics

The goal of the game is for each player to survive to the end of the school year.

This _should be easy_: most combat interactions are not fatal.

## Skill Checks

Non-combat interactions in the game are resolved with [Skill Checks](./skill_checks.md). Players have a variety of skills, and they draw cards
from their personal decks to determine whether or not they succeed at these tasks.

## Combat

Players and adversaries draw hands of cards, then play them into a variety of "bins" that are available to them, corresponding
with unique combat abilities.

These cards generate Strike and Defend points, which can be used to both generate and offset damage.

Players start every combat with 20 HP, a number that resets with every combat.

When a player reaches 0 HP, they do not die, but instead must buy 10 more HP. In order to do so, they
must take 3 corruption points.

When a player reaches 0 HP for a second time, they suffer _consequences_, which are generally non-fatal.
This costs them _more_ Corruption Points, and they wake up in their room the next day with a new Manipulation.

A sufficient number of Corruption points will permanently retire the Player, although the exact number is only known by the GM.
