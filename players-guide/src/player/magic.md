# Magic

Every player starts the game with 1 spell, except for **Dull** players,
who start the game with no spells and cannot learn spells.

Once a spell is chosen, no other players can choose that spell.

Spells have both a **Combat** and a **Skill** component.

* In general, the Combat portion of the spell can be used in fights,
* and the Skill portion of the spell can be used the rest of the time.
* Although the Skill _can_ be used in Combat with the Movement/Skill Check ability


## Magic Corruption

Players can mark Corruption Points on the "Magic Corruption" box on their Report Card. When all three of the _Corruption Circles_ are filled, you may learn a new Spell.
