    <description>
* While you have Unresolved Trauma, you are Strange.
* You can not use "Charming" skills.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Charming, now you are Strange).
* If you were already Strange: take one Corruption point at the end of every Combat.
* A successful FINANCIAL AID (Empathy) check can downgrade this to Stress.
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.
