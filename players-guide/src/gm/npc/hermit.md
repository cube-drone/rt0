# Herman Ito

Herman Ito, reclusive billionaire. A small, old man with round sunglasses.
Owner of, among others, Itophonic Headphones, Ito Getaways, ItoVR,
He wasn't the face of the Paradise Lua project, but he was always
the financial backing.

His goal was to completely insulate himself from humanity, to create a sanctuary
where nobody could harm him, bother him, or even appear on his radar.

His service staff are myriad and tuned exactly to his preferences.
