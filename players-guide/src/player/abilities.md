# Abilities
Every player is provided with a Report Card page, which looks like this:

TODO::ART

A player must choose 1 Ability from the set of 6: Strong, Fast, Clever, Wise, Lucky, Charming

The player's [Major Arcana](./choosing_major_arcana.md) will also give them an ability, for free.
Choose an ability by circling it on your character sheet.

These are the players' Chosen Abilities.

#### Body:
* Strong - _Big muscle. Strong. Lift heavy._
* Fast - _Nimble. Quick._

#### Mind:
* Clever - _Quick-thinking._
* Wise - _Careful, thoughtful._

#### Heart:
* Lucky - _Things just work out more often for this player._
* Charming - _Charismatic. Magnetic._

A player must also Cross Out 1 Ability from the set of 6.

This is the players' Weak Ability. Depending on the ability that's been crossed out, write the following next to it:

* Strong - Weak (Hits harder in combat)
* Fast - Slow (Dodges easier in combat)
* Clever - Dull (Gets to pick more skills, spells)
* Wise - Foolish (More card recycle in combat)
* Lucky - Unlucky (Gets a better deck of cards)
* Charming - Repulsive (Gets access to some unusual abilities, accumulates less corruption)

(It is impossible to have both an Ability and a Weak Ability for the same thing: A player can't be Strong and Weak, or Lucky and Unlucky)

As an example, a player might be Strong and Clever, but not Lucky, or they might be Fast and Charming, but not Wise.

## Lucky or Unlucky

If a player is Lucky, remove all Aces and Twos from their deck.
If a player is Unlucky, remove all Kings and Queens from their deck.
