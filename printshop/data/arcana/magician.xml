### Skill: This Was All Part of My Plan
Once per Day, The Magician can have planned ahead, retroactively.

#### Planned Ahead, Retroactively?
* This means that The Magician can declare that they had a plan in place for a situation that has just arisen, and that they have already taken steps to prepare for it.
* This can include lots of things: having a piece of vital equipment on hand, or having bribed someone in advance.
* The GM can veto or negotiate this.
