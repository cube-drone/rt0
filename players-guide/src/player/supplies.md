# Supplies

Play requires one Tarot deck per player, as well as a variety of printable handouts.

These Tarot decks can be _unique_ and _interesting_ (if players wish to buy fancy or custom decks),
but the game is planned around the standard, public-domain
[78-card Rider Waite Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot) -
if you _do_ choose to use an unusual deck, make sure it has 78 cards, and if it makes any substititions for the original deck
("coins" instead of "pentacles" is common), make sure you know what they are.

The gamemaster should also have a deck of tarot cards.

The expectation is that pencils, pens, and paper are available.

The game also has printable worksheets ([Printables](./supplies/printables.md)) intended to make the game easier to run.

numbered 0 through 21. The Fool, The Magician, Lovers, The Tower, The Hermit, all the way through Judgement
