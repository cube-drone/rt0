# ED - Eddy

Eddy is not so much a chooseable, playable major arcana as they are a temporary character, intended
for players who maybe only intend to stay for a single session, or for players who've died and
would like to participate in the rest of the session as a temporary character.

The GM is encouraged to have an Eddy or two tucked away, for a rainy day.

Eddy is a friendly robot who bumbles along and helps out the players.

Eddies are sentient and cheerfully desire to help out, but bumbling.

Eddy is a nickname: Eddy's full name is Ed25519, but they go by "Eddy" for short.

Eddy is not the only "Eddy" - there are dozens of Eddy-class robots who might stop in and help the players out.

## Skills

Each Eddy can choose only one Skill. That Skill is related to the automated task they perform around Paradise Lua.

## Combat

Combat scaling doesn't apply to Eddies: if there are 3 players and 2 Eddies, the combat should be designed for 3 players.

## Shared Deck

You may not have enough tarot decks to support all Eddies: for this reason, none of their abilities are deck-modifying. They can just draw cards from the DM deck.
