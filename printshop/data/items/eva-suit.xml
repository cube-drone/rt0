* This suit allows you to go outside of Paradise Lua without _immediately dying_.
* Wearing the EVA Suit _in_ Paradise Lua is surprisingly beneficial in combat situations:
   * The suit is covered in a thick armored poncho and steel helmet, granting you 3 Shields on every combat turn.
   * The helmet is airtight, and has its own oxygen supply, rendering you invulnerable to gas and liquid-based attacks.
* All skill checks except for FINAID made _while wearing the EVA Suit_ are made with Penalty: it's hard to move around in this thing.
* Putting on the EVA Suit in Combat takes a full round and a successful Medium GYM check.

It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but neither is depressurizing your lungs.
