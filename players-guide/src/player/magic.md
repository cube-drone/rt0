# Magic

Every player starts the game with 1 spell, except for **Dull** players,
who start the game with no spells and cannot learn spells.

Once a spell is chosen, no other players can choose that spell.

The set of spells that no player has chosen remains in the game: some effects take advantage of the set of unchosen spells.

Spells have both a **Combat** and a **Skill** component. In general, the Combat portion of the spell can be used in fights, and the Skill portion of the spell can be used the rest of the time.
