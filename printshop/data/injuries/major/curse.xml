* While you have a Curse, you are `Unlucky`.
* You can not use "Lucky" skills.
* If you were already "Unlucky": remove all 10s and Knights from your deck, as well as The Fool and The Sun.
* A successful MISC check can downgrade this to a Minor Injury.
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to a Massive, Painful Scar.
