## Unarmed Strike
_You don't need a weapon to be dangerous. Hit them! Hit them hard!_

* Place Wands or Swords on Unarmed Strike.
* Cards sitting on Unarmed Strike remain there.
* When the sum of the numerical values on the cards reaches (or exceeds) 10, discard all cards on Unarmed Strike and
  * deal 5 (Strong: 7 / Weak: 3) Damage or
  * deal 2 (Strong: 3 / Weak: 1) Ranged Damage.

## Defend
_Dodge, or brace yourself for the impact. Either way, you're ready._

* Place Cups or Pentacles on Defend.
* When the sum of the numerical values on the cards reaches (or exceeds) 10, discard all cards on Defend and
  * generate 5 (Fast: 7 / Slow: 3) Shield.

## Concentrate
_You take a moment to focus: the world slows down around you._

* Place Major Arcana cards on Concentrate.
* Cards sitting on Concentrate remain there.
* When there are 2 (Wise: 1, Foolish: 3) cards on Concentrate:
  * discard all cards on Concentrate and
  * draw a new card
  * if Clever, deal 1 Magic Damage and gain 1 Shield
  * if Charming, you may choose to make an Adversary redraw their Intent

## Movement / Skill
_I, too, like to move it move it._

* Place any card on Movement / Skill.
* When there are 2 (Fast: 1, Slow: 3) cards on Movement / Skill:
* Discard all cards on Movement / Skill and
  * Move 1 Zone or
  * Perform a non-combat action, such as hacking a computer or forcing open a door.
     (_Shuffle your discard pile into your deck, then make a skill check_)

Some actions during battle call for Skill Checks. "I hack the computer while the battle is raging on", or "I force open the door".

Once the player has "paid" for the skill check, while keeping their hand and any current combat cards separate, the player shuffles their discard pile into their deck, then uses the deck to perform a skill check as usual.

## Run Away
_You're not a coward, you're just... tactical. Tactically shitting yourself._

* Place any card on Run Away.
* Once a card has been placed on Run Away, the next card must either be one higher than the highest card on Run Away, or one lower than the lowest card on Run Away.
* When there are 3 cards (Fast: 2, Slow: 4) on Run Away:
  * Move yourself to any unoccupied Zone in the current Room or
  * Remove yourself from battle entirely. Your participation in this combat is over! The GM decides where you are hiding.
* Then: discard all cards on Run Away.

You might be wondering: "Can I make a run out of Major Arcana?". The answer is yes! (_Although you might want to save them for other things._)

You can use Major Arcana cards to make a run - using the numerical value of their Roman Numerals:

So, for example, you could play The Magician (I) after The Fool (0), or The Lovers (VI) after The Chariot (VII).

## Catastrophe
_In the heat of battle, you've made a terrible mistake._

* Any time The Tower is drawn, it must be played immediately and before any other cards: on Catastrophe.
* The player discards all cards on all of their abilities, including The Tower, then shuffles the discard pile back into their deck and ends their turn.
* If Lucky, gain 10 Shield.

## Friendship
_You can't help but feel a connection to the people around you._

* Corruption may be marked on Friendship.
* At the end of the day, draw 1 (Charming: 2) empty corruption circles on Friendship.
* Players with Strange may not use Friendship.

## Honk
_Honk!_

* Players with Foolish must use Honk, once per turn.
* Any player can use Honk.
* Play any card on Honk, then discard it.
* Make a funny face at the GM, or a silly noise, or honk, or blow a raspberry, or say "Farts ahoy!" in your best pirate voice.
