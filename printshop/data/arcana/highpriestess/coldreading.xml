* You may play a card on Cold Reading at any time: when you do:
   * Choose two of Strong, Fast, Lucky, Charming, and Clever:
   * Palm Reading acts as if you **also** had these traits.
   * However, if you draw The Tower or The Moon, take 1 Corruption Point.
* You may discard the card on Cold Reading at any time. This cancels the above effect.
