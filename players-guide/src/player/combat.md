# Combat
Combat is triggered any time the players get into a scuffle with an adversary or adversaries.

The goal of Combat is to deal damage to adversaries until they stop fighting.

## Summary
Players and adversaries draw hands of cards, then play them into a variety of "bins" that are available to them, corresponding
with unique combat abilities.

These cards generate Strike and Defend points, which can be used to both generate and offset damage.

## Hit Points
Players start every combat with 20 HP, a number that resets with _every combat_.

When a player reaches 0 HP, they do not die, but instead must buy 15 more HP. In order to do so, they
must take a Major Injury.

A sufficient number of Corruption points will permanently retire the Player, although the exact number is only known by the GM.

## The Order
A Round of battle is a cycle where every participant gets one turn.

First, an Intent is drawn for every Adversary. This is a card that determines what the Adversary will
do on their turn. Some Adversaries draw Intents face-up, some draw Intents face down.

Then, players each take a turn. Fast players first, then players without Fast or Slow, then Slow players.

Finally, each Adversary does whatever their Intent indicates that they will do.

## Movement

Movement in combat happens on a small grid.

Most common rooms in RT:0 are 3x3 grids. Each square of the grid constitutes a Zone, and the Zone can
be shared by as many folks as care to cram themselves in to it. If you are in the same Zone as an Adversary,
the two of you are in melee range of one another.

* Damage can only hit when both the damag-er and damag-ee are in the same Zone.
* Ranged Damage can hit anyone, from anywhere.

Some rooms are large, these are represented by a 5x5 grid.

Some rooms are cramped, these are represented by a 1x1 grid. (_Which is, notably, just a single square. Sorry, ranged abilities!_)

## A Turn

At the beginning of their turn, a player draws 5 cards from their deck.
If they have cards in their hand already at the beginning of their turn, they may keep them.

If there are not enough cards in their deck to draw 5 cards,
they shuffle their discard pile into their deck, and then draw 5 cards from their deck.

These cards constitute the player's "hand" for the turn.

The player plays cards on the various Combat abilities available to their character.
If a player can not play a card, it is discarded at the end of the turn: there is no saving of cards for the next hand.

## Numerical Values of Tarot Cards

* Ace - 1
* 2 through 10 - as listed
* Page - 11
* Knight - 12
* Queen - 13
* King - 14
* Major Arcana - use the Roman Numeral: The Fool is 0, The Chariot is 7, Death is 13, etc.

## Conclusion & Supremacy

The Combat is over when all adversaries have fled or been knocked down to 0HP.

Adversaries knocked down to 0HP may have been knocked unconscious, killed, or simply incapacitated: that's
up to the players and the GM.

When a Combat concludes, open up the Supremacy Worksheet:
* If every player has full HP, mark one tally in the Supremacy box.
* If any player has full HP, mark one tally in the Supremacy box.
* If every player has accumulated 0 Corruption, mark one tally in the Supremacy box.
* If any player has accumulated 0 Corruption, mark one tally in the Supremacy box.

Accumulated Supremacy makes combat _more difficult_ as the game goes on.

## A Sample Adversary
This is _Brock_, an example of the kind of fellow one might get in a scuffle with:

### Brock: A Regular Guy With No Special Qualities Whatsoever, But He Is Definitely a Real Jerk
HP: 30

* Simple: Brock draws 1 card per turn.
* Mobile: If there is nobody to hit in Brock's zone, Brock will move 1 space towards any player on his turn.
* Swords, Wands: "Punch", Do 8 melee damage.
* Cups, Pentacles: "Dodge", Generate 6 shields.
* Major Arcana: "Pocket Sand!", Make one player in melee range "Weak" until the beginning of Brock's next turn.
