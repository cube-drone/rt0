* Take 1 Corruption Point to activate Better Not Tell You Now.
* Choose an Adversary with less than 30 remaining HP.
* For the remainder of combat, that Adversary will draw Intent cards as usual, but you will choose how they interpret that Intent.
* You may also swap "Players" and "Adversaries" on their Intent card: for example, if their Intent is "Adversaries in the same Zone gain 2 Shield",
    you may choose to have Players in the same Zone gain 2 Shield instead.
