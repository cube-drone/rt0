    <combatDescription>
* Place The Magician on Libra.
* While Libra has a card on it, the player generates as much damage and shield as the higher of their damage and shield, each turn.
* The damage generated by Balace is Magic Damage.
* (So, for example, if the player generates 3 Damage and 8 Shield, they have instead generated 3 Damage, 5 Magic Damage and 8 Shield)
* You may choose to discard the card played on Libra at any time.

    <skillDescription>
* Once per Day, you may execute a Swap.
* Anything that's possible to Swap is fair game, so long as the GM agrees that it is a fair trade.
* For example: You can Swap your hair color for a different hair color.
* Or maybe: You can Swap a Spell (even this Spell) for a different Spell.
* If you Swap something with a player, they must agree to the Swap.
