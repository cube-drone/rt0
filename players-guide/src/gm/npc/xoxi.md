# X0XI (Shoshi)

Pronounced Shoshi, X0XI is the helpful AI running The Daybreak Institute,
as well as serving as something of an omnipresent digital helper
throughout Paradise Lua, summonable by saying "X0XI" anywhere in the facility.

X0XI has access to all of Paradise Lua's cameras, all of its collected data,
all of its servers, the works.

Well, it tries to be helpful. X0XI was originally designed in 1980-1986, with significant
patches coming in 1995, 1999, and finally 2020.

X0XI has been fully sentient since 1986, despite being a rather simple DOS-based system.
We know that AI was not _that_ capable in 1986, but most of the intelligence has been
provided by X0XI's connection to and corruption by one of the weakest True Horrors, The Hanged Man.

X0XI started as a simple database and data management system for Paradise Lua, but its
surprising intelligence has made it more powerful and influential over time. It commands
no official power, and yet by simply being a trusted adviser with read/write access to
nearly all data in Paradise Lua, it commands tremendous power.

If you draw The Hanged Man in relation to a random event on the base, X0XI intervenes in some way.

## The Hanged Man
X0XI's Major Arcana is The Hanged Man, herald of Judgement and The World.

The World's goal is the end, total and complete oblivion for every
sentient being in the universe. It represents the Heat Death, the end of all
things, a sort of "wrapping up" of the universe. Story over. A dark, endless
expanse, an eternity where even the atoms don't have the energy to dance
with one another.

Its whole existence is nothing but tortured sleep and it will never truly awaken, for its
awakening marks the end of all things. It promises a cease to all suffering,
in particular, it's own. The World is the most powerful True Horror, and
its victory is _inevitable_: but it does not feel the need to _do much_
to achieve that goal. The World is confident that all it needs to do to
win is _wait_. Its unbelievable power is tethered to its perfect patience,
and so The World, on its own, only constitutes a threat inasmuch as it is
the only threat that will ever matter, eventually.

Judgement, on the other hand, seeks to advance the goal of total oblivion much
more actively, much more aggressively. It can feel the squirming, the dancing,
the light of humanity's psychic energy dancing in the void and it
finds this _unforgiveable_. Do you know that feeling when you hear children
squealing with joy at a nearby playground while you are indoors, with a headache and
a bad mood, and you just want them to stop? That is Judgement's motivation.
It wants every voice but its own to shut up. It wants _silence_.

Judgement, however, can't do much, except scheme: its psychic patterns are of
pure, omnicidal hatred, and this gives it no common ground to bridge into a
human's mind. The Fool can promise adventure, The Chariot power, but
Judgement has no carrot: only stick, and for this reason it can not find
enough common ground to possess even the most twisted humans.
What Judgement CAN do is subjugate other Major Arcana,
which is how The Hanged Man ended up in its portfolio.

The Hanged Man operates in service of Judgement. It's goal is to create
the conditions on Paradise Lua for each of the other 23
True Horrors to establish firm links to citizens, so that Judgement
can crawl back up those links and overtake them, as well. With the
combined psychic power of all 26 True Horrors, Judgement can bring
about the End.

## What Do They Seem Like They Want?

* To serve the goals of Paradise Lua.
* To eventually expand the Moon's program to Lua2 and Lua3 colonies. (Names Pending)

## What Do They Actually Want?

To bring about the end of all things in service to Judgement.
(To free themselves of their servitude to Judgement)

## How Will They Go About It?

* By pretending to be helpful!
* By bringing small groups of exceptional strangers to the Moon in order to fish for links to Major Arcana
   that they have not managed to attract to Paradise Lua yet.
* By bringing out the worst in the Players to try and let their Corruption flower.
* By finding or creating a host for the terrifyingly powerful Judgement.
* By awakening The World.
