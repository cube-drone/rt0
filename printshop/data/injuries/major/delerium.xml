* While you have Delerium, you are `Dull`.
* You can not use "Clever" skills.
* If you were already Dull: now, you cannot use any skills at all.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Clever, now you are Dull).
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.
