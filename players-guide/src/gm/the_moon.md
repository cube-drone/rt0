# The Moon

## Some Basic Moon Facts
* during the (almost) 15 day "day", the moon's supernatural effects are at their weakest, with their nadir at full moon
* during the (almost) 15 day "night", the moon's supernatural effects are at their strongest, with their apex at total darkness (new moon).
* the base is located at the resource-rich north pole which enjoys constant sunlight
* 16% of earth's gravity
* lunar soil provides oxygen
* lunar ice provides water
* ample solar power
* human shit and worms provide fertilizer
* loads of radiation on the surface
* because of the lack of atmosphere, weird temperatures, and high radiation, most of the base is located underground
* surface structures are often inflatable
* modern spacesuit designs have a wetsuit-like inner shell and a radation overcoat

## Time

A full moon "day" takes 1 Earth Month, which makes it not useful for human circadian rhythms, which is why the underground base has its own day/night cycle enforced with artificial lights, synchronized with their original home base in Las Vegas, Nevada (Pacific Standard Time).

Timekeeping on Paradise Lua is almost all done in 24-hour time.

## Going Outside Will Kill You

The tl;dr of this is that "going on to the moon without an EVA suit is a very bad idea and will cause your player characters to die very quickly".

Depressurization without an EVA Suit is bad. Unlike what you might have seen in science fiction
media, though, it will not cause the players' blood to boil or their eyes to explode. Human tissue
is strong enough to keep the air that's in - in. Surface liquid will boil off, though, which is bad for the eyes.

Nope, mooned humans just die for the regular reason that humans without access to air die: they suffocate.

* Rapid depressurization creates a [Minor Injury: Blinded](../player/generated/majorinjuries.md#blinded) after 30 seconds.
* No air creates a [Critical Injury](../player/generated/criticalinjuries.md) ("suffocation") every 30 seconds.
* Okay, so: let's imagine you have a source of air. Managing the _pressure_ of that air in such a way as _not to die_ is a subject of more than a little detail. Modeling that in detail is going to be frustrating, so let's short form it:
   * If players do something like trying to regulate their own air pressure, [bringing a can of air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCX6H90RvPU), or hopping out of an Airlock without letting their EVA suit equalize its pressure, give them a Critical Injury ("[barotrauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barotrauma)") after 10 minutes.
* If players have a way to manage air, the next problem is severe radiation, which will give them the [Major Injory: Disease](../player/generated/majorinjuries.md#disease)
  ("radiation poisoning") after 1 hour.
* Temperature is the next problem. Good news/bad news: even though the temperature is _very dangerous_, there's not a lot of medium to do stuff with the players' heat: the moon's exosphere has basically no pressure, so even though the temperatures are wild (-120°C, +120°C), the players' temperature will shift _relatively slowly_. However, in the sunlight,
  players will slowly roast (nowhere for solar heat to go), and outside of it, players will slowly freeze. After 6 hours of uninterrupted light or dark, give players a
  Critical Injury ("thermal problems").

## EVA Suits

If you go outside in an EVA Suit, most of these problems are moot.

EVA Suits manage air, temperature, block radiation, provide a water tank for hydration, and manage excretion (somewhat): but, an EVA suit only carries enough air and water to supply these functions for about 4 hours of Moon Adventure.

EVA Suits can also be paired up with EVA Vehicles, which can resupply some of the suit's supply with a larger, rolling tank. Vehicle-paired EVA adventures can go much longer than EVA Suit ones, with Moontrikes extending the trip's viability to 8 hours, and Moontrucks to 24 hours (past which "sleep, bathroom, and hunger issues" start to get so pressing that while longer trips might be possible, they're unwise.) Trips longer than that require a fully pressurized, self-contained rolling Moontanker (of which only one has ever been built) which essentially provides a fully pressurized micro-moonbase on the go, with its own airlocks and EVA Suits.
