# Abilities
Every player is provided with a Report Card page, which looks like this:

TODO::ART

A player must choose 1 Ability from the set of 6: Strong, Fast, Clever, Wise, Lucky, Charming

The player's [Major Arcana](./choosing_major_arcana.md) will also give them an ability, for free.
Choose an ability by circling it on your character sheet.

These are the players' Abilities.

* Strong - _Big muscle. Strong. Lift heavy. Strong characters deal extra damage._
* Fast - _Nimble. Quick. Fast characters move and block more easily in combat._
* Clever - _Quick-thinking. Creative. Clever characters have more effective magic._
* Wise - _Careful, thoughtful. Wise characters draw more cards._
* Lucky - _Things just work out more often for this player. Lucky characters get a better deck._
* Charming - _Charismatic. Magnetic. Friendly. Kind. Charming characters are more resistant to corruption._

A player must also choose a Weakness.

This is the opposite of one of the Abilities.

* Weak - _Small muscle. Noodle-arms. Weak characters deal less damage._
* Slow - _Plodding, stodgy. Slow characters can't move or block as well in combat._
* Dull - _Slow-witted, mundane. Dull characters can't use magic at all._
* Foolish - _Foolish characters waste cards on things that don't matter._
* Unlucky - _Unlucky characters get a worse deck._
* Repulsive - _Unfriendly, cruel, callous. Repulsive characters are less resistant to corruption._

(It is impossible to have both an Ability and a Weakness for the same thing: A player can't be Strong and Weak at the same time, or Lucky and Unlucky at the same time)

## Lucky or Unlucky Deck Modification

* If a player is Lucky, remove all Aces and Twos from their deck.
* If a player is Unlucky, remove all Kings and Queens from their deck.
