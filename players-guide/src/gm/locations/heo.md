# HEO

Paradise Lua is paired with the HEO Supercannon, a large installation in Henderson, Nevada.

The Henderson base is largely responsible for Paradise Lua's limited connection with Earth, but
thanks to a significant dip in the value of rare earth metals, it's underfunded and staffed with
a skeleton crew.

No space elevators here: just about anything that needs to go to the moon gets fired out of a
railgun that is several kilometers long. Things that get fired out of said railgun need to be
able to cope with a lot more acceleration than a soft, squishy human can handle.
