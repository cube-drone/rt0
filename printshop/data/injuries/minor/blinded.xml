* While you are Blinded
* Any skill check that requires sight gets a Penalty.
* In Combat:
   * All Ranged Damage becomes Damage, and all Magic Ranged Damage becomes Magic Damage.
   * Any effect that targets all Adversaries will instead target all Adversaries in your Zone.
   * Any time you would deal Damage, draw and discard a card from the top of the deck.
      * If it is a 1-5, you miss and deal no Damage.
* Play Temperance to remove Blinded.
* Take 1 Corruption Point to instantly heal Blinded.
* Outside of Combat, a Medium AID check and a few minutes of rest will remove Blinded.
