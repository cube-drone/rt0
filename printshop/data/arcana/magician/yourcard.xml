* When Three Card Monte's effect triggers, after drawing the face-down cards, but before the GM shows you one:
   * You may guess which card is the one that will be revealed.
   * If you are correct, you do not need to play the game: the card is immediately added to your hand, treating it as a Magician.
   * If you are incorrect, the game proceeds as normal, but if you lose AND the card you guessed is not one of the three cards, take 1 Corruption Point.
