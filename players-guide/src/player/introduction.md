## Story
TODO::

* teenagers on the moon
* in a moonbase built a long time ago
* don't remember the last month of their lives
* sinister computer makes them follow rules, play stupid games
* they think it's a school, but it's a prison
* the people who stranded them here hoped it would be sufficient

## A Quick Overview of Gameplay

In a modern table-top roleplaying game, players design a "character" for themselves, choosing their attributes and qualities.

The **GM** will describe a scene to the players, and then players will respond by describing
how their character would respond to that situation.

While players are exploring the moon, they will manage most of their interactions using [Skill Checks](./skill_checks.md),
short interactions where they draw cards from their Tarot decks to determine success or failure at a variety of tasks.

Periodically, players will enter [Combat](./combat.md), where they will draw hands of cards and play them to
deal damage and block damage to a variety of _moon adversaries_.

## Supplies

Play requires one Tarot deck per player, as well as a variety of printable handouts.

These Tarot decks can be _unique_ and _interesting_ (if players wish to buy fancy or custom decks),
but the game is planned around the standard, public-domain
[78-card Rider Waite Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot) -
if you _do_ choose to use an unusual deck, make sure it has 78 cards, and if it makes any substititions for the original deck
(say, "coins" instead of "pentacles"), make sure you know what they are.

if there are shared card pools? (TODO: are there?)
The game is _slightly easier to play_ if each deck is distinguishable from one another in some way.

if there are NPC checks? (TODO: are there?)
The gamemaster should also have a deck of tarot cards.

The gamemaster should have a single coin, with a Heads side and a Tails side.

Each player should have a large, colorful, permanent pen or marker.
A different color for each player is thematically appropriate but not strictly necessary.

### A Quick Guide to the Tarot Deck

There are 78 cards in a Tarot deck, and some terms you'll need to be familiar with to understand
the rules of Remaining Teenagers: Zero.

The first 22 cards of the Tarot are called the **Major Arcana**: These are the named cards, and they're
numbered 0 through 21. The Fool, The Magician, Lovers, The Tower, The Hermit, all the way through Judgement
and The World.

The remaining 56 cards are called the **Minor Arcana**: These are 14 cards, divided into 4 suits: Swords,
Wands, Cups, and Pentacles.

### How To Make a Tarot Deck out of Two Decks of Playing Cards and a Permanent Marker

Tarot decks can be quite expensive. Regular playing cards, on the other hand, can be acquired at
any gas station.

### From one deck of cards:
* Write "0 / The Fool" on one of the two provided jokers.
* remove the other provided joker, and all "rules of draw & stud poker" style inserts.

### From the other deck of cards
* take the Queens, cross out the Qs, and write "P" nearby, to make Pages in each suit.
* on 20 of the remaining cards, preferring cards with lots of _space_, cross out the suit and rank ("2 diamonds")
* Write in:
* 1 / The Magician
* 2 / The High Priestess
* 3 / The Empress
* 4 / The Emperor
* 5 / The Hierophant
* 6 / The Lovers
* 7 / The Chariot
* 8 / Strength
* 9 / The Hermit
* 10 / Wheel of Fortune
* 11 / Justice
* 12 / The Hanged Man
* 13 / Death
* 14 / Temperance
* 15 / The Devil
* 16 / The Tower
* 17 / THe Star
* 18 / The Moon
* 19 / The Sun
* 20 / Judgement
* 21 / The World
* Somewhere memorable, write: "Clubs -> Wands, Spades -> Swords, Hearts -> Cups, Diamonds -> Pentacles"
* Add the Pages and the newly created Major Arcana to the first deck. Remove the remaining cards.
* The final deck should have 78 cards in it.

## Content Warning

This game features _teenagers dying_. Like, quite a bit and fairly unavoidably.

Beyond that, the content of the game is going to be largely a conversation with
your Gamemaster. Be sure to familiarize yourselves with the [Safety Tools](./safety.md).

## Disclaimer Vis-a-Vis Occult Shenanigans

This game features ideas and elements of cartomancy, astrology, and esoteric
occult beliefs which are not taken terribly _seriously_.

If you are a deep believer in these concepts, either out of religious aversion
to them, or spiritual attraction to them, elements of this game may not
be up your alley.
