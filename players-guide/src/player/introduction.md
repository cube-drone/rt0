# Introduction

_Twenty-one haunted teenagers must survive one school year alone on a moonbase with an insane computer._

Remaining Teenagers: Zero, (or **RT:0** for short), is a tabletop roleplaying game.

In this game, a handful of players will take on the roles of teenagers with mysterious powers,
while their **GM** (Gamemaster) will help manage the simulation of their year in space.

## Story
TODO::

* teenagers on the moon
* in a moonbase built a long time ago
* don't remember the last month of their lives
* sinister computer makes them follow rules, play stupid games
* they think it's a school, but it's a prison
* the people who stranded them here hoped it would be sufficient

## Supplies

Play requires one Tarot deck per player, as well as a variety of printable handouts.

Each deck should be fitted with opaque sleeves? (edit: opaque tarot sleeves are difficult to source)

These Tarot decks can be _unique_ and _interesting_ (if players wish to buy fancy or custom decks),
but the game is planned around the standard, public-domain
[78-card Rider Waite Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot) -

if there are shared card pools? (TODO: are there?)
The game is _slightly easier to play_ if each deck is distinguishable from one another in some way.

if there are NPC checks? (TODO: are there?)
The gamemaster should also have a deck of tarot cards.

The gamemaster should have a single coin, with a Heads side and a Tails side.

Each player should have a large, colorful, permanent pen or marker.
A different color for each player is thematically appropriate but not strictly necessary.

## Content Warning

This game features _teenagers dying_. Like, quite a bit and fairly unavoidably.

Beyond that, the content of the game is going to be largely a conversation with
your Gamemaster. Be sure to familiarize yourselves with the [Safety Tools](./safety.md).

## Disclaimer Vis-a-Vis Occult Shenanigans

This game features ideas and elements of cartomancy, astrology, and esoteric
occult beliefs which are not taken terribly _seriously_.

If you are a deep believer in these concepts, either out of religious aversion
to them, or spiritual attraction to them, elements of this game may not
be up your alley.
