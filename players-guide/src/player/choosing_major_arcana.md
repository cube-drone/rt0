# Choosing a Major Arcana

Players each choose a major arcana that resonates with them.

This is like choosing a Class in a class-based RPG: your Major Arcana represents the broad archetype
into which your player fits, and provides a variety of abilities and skills within that archetype.

The Major Arcana available to the players are:

* [The Fool](./arcana/0_the_fool.md) - A class clown. Carefree. Naive. Random.
* [The Magician](./generated/magician.md) - A mastermind spellcaster who always has a plan.
* [The High Priestess](./arcana/2_the_high_priestess.md) - A fortuneteller who can see into the future.

Each Arcana provides a handful of changes to the game: The Fool, for example, can treat "The Fool" as a wildcard, and gains the Lucky ability.

Each Arcana also provides a Skill: The Magician, for example, has "This Was All Part of My Plan". The Skill is intended for use outside of combat, although the Skill can be used in Combat with the Movement/Skill Check ability.

Each player also chooses 2 of their Arcana's **Arcana Abilities** to start off the game.

Each **Arcana Ability** comes with a **Corruption Upgrade**: you can mark Corruption Points on the Corruption Upgrade.
When all three of the _Corruption Circles_ are filled, you gain the Corruption Upgrade, which makes the Arcana Ability more powerful.

## Arcana Abilities

<!--
The initial run of the Major Arcana used exactly the first six cards and included:

* The Empress (A mama bear who hits like a truck when her allies are in danger),
* The Emperor (A charismatic leader with socks, sandals, and a wallet full of utility skills)
* The Hierophant (A bookish nerd who's armor is his speed)

then, I thought those seemed boring and replaced them with:

* The Lovers (pairs)
* Strength (they brought a lion)
* * Death (???)

however, ultimately I'd like to make sure that the game feels balanced and playable with just the first three classes before I add any more.
