* When there are 3 cards (Fast: 2, Slow: 4) on Run Away:
  * Move yourself to any unoccupied Zone in the current Room or
  * Remove yourself from battle entirely. Your participation in this combat is over! The GM decides where you are hiding.
* Then: discard all cards on Run Away.

You might be wondering: "Can I make a run out of Major Arcana?". The answer is yes! (_Although you might want to save them for other things._)

You can use Major Arcana cards to make a run - using the numerical value of their Roman Numerals:

So, for example, you could play The Magician (I) after The Fool (0), or The Lovers (VI) after The Chariot (VII).
