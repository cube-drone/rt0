# Playlist

Of course there is an [official playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmVb1OknmNJt4VKJCP823D3kNFJKQxN77) of Remaining Teenagers: Zero. Not because there _needs_ to be, but because concocting mixtapes is one of life's great joys.

Do _you_ have a themed playlist that would be perfect for this? [DM me](https://mastodon.social/@cube_drone) or e-mail me at `fuckin-playlists-how-do-they-work@gooble.email`, and I'll add it to this page.
