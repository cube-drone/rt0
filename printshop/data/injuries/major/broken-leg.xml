* While you have a Broken Leg, you are **Slow**.
* You can not use Fast skills.
* If you were already Slow: now, you cannot gain shields, at all.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Fast, now you are Slow).
* A successful AID (First Aid) check can downgrade this to a Splinted Leg.
* After two nights of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.
* Take 4 Corruption Points to instantly heal Broken Leg.
