# Lore

loose-ass ideas:

* players are expected to bring their own laptop, phone, or tablet?
* players update a shared wiki as they go?
* the GM can drop documents in the wiki
* players update a shared binder?


* the moon base, Moon Unit Zappa, was built by SNASA (Secret NASA) in the year 2004 to secure, contain and protect supernatural and paranormal mysteries and phenomena
* SNASA is a branch of The Black Chamber (see also: Majestic 12, Delta Green)
* the children are stored in three 7-chambered revolving stasis chambers in an orbiter and "fired" on to the moon-base 7 at a time
* OK Computer is a helpful computer corrupted by an ancient and vast psychic intelligence attempting to scour the world clean of humans in order to finally _sleep_.
* timers, counting down over character heads
* the players need to defeat the other teenagers, and in doing so claim some of their powers
* the player is played in a 12-day cycle: every 3 days they encounter 7 new teenagers, on the final 3 days they face OK Computer
* this RPG is designed to be played multiple times: there's more lore to be encountered then can be discovered in one run
