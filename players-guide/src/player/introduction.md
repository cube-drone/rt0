# Introduction

_Seven haunted teenagers must survive one school year on a moonbase with an insane computer._

Remaining Teenagers: Zero, (or **RT:0** for short), is a sci-fi/fantasy tabletop roleplaying game played with Tarot decks.

In this game, a handful of players will take on the roles of teenagers with mysterious powers,
while their **GM** (Game Manager) will help manage the simulation of their school year on the moon.

RT:0 is intended to be played with 3-4 players and one GM.
It might also work with other player counts!

## Story

Paradise Lua is the first ever moon colony. Fully privately funded and operating outside of the
boundaries of any government entity,  it was marketed as both a luxurious
land-ownership opportunity for the hyper rich and a brave new frontier for the common man.
After it's founding more than 15 years ago, however, news and footage from Paradise Lua has trailed off.
Nobody seems interested in space anymore. What happened up there?

Then, Paradise Lua quietly announced their ACCELER8 program. 8 exceptional teenagers from Earth would
be invited to a prestigious private academy on the moon: The Zakharov Institute.
It made the news, and thousands of teenagers applied, but only 8 were chosen.

1 died in transit.

The remaining teenagers must survive their school year on Paradise Lua.

Bad News: Paradise Lua is a dangerous place.

Good News: The teenagers quickly discover reservoirs of inexplicable psychic powers.

Bad News: Using these powers comes at a terrible cost.

## A Quick Overview of Gameplay

In a modern table-top roleplaying game, players design a "character" for themselves, choosing their attributes and qualities.

The **GM** (Game Manager) will describe a scene to the players, and then players will respond by describing
how their character would respond to that situation.

While players are exploring the moon, they will manage most of their interactions using [Skill Checks](./skill_checks.md),
short interactions where they draw cards from their Tarot decks to determine success or failure at a variety of tasks.

Periodically, players will enter [Combat](./combat.md), where they will draw hands of cards and play them to
deal damage to and block damage from a variety of _moon adversaries_.

## Supplies

Play requires one Tarot deck per player, as well as a variety of printable handouts.

These Tarot decks can be _unique_ and _interesting_ (if players wish to buy fancy or custom decks),
but the game is planned around the standard, public-domain
[78-card Rider Waite Tarot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_Tarot) -
if you _do_ choose to use an unusual deck, make sure it has 78 cards, and if it makes any substititions for the original deck
("coins" instead of "pentacles" is common), make sure you know what they are.

The gamemaster should also have a deck of tarot cards.

Each player should have a large, colorful, permanent pen or marker.
A different color for each player is thematically appropriate but not strictly necessary.

### A Quick Guide to the Tarot Deck

There are 78 cards in a Tarot deck, and some terms you'll need to be familiar with to understand
the rules of Remaining Teenagers: Zero.

The first 22 cards of the Tarot are called the **Major Arcana**: These are the named cards, and they're
numbered 0 through 21. The Fool, The Magician, Lovers, The Tower, The Hermit, all the way through Judgement
and The World.

The remaining 56 cards are called the **Minor Arcana**: These are 14 cards, divided into 4 suits: Swords,
Wands, Cups, and Pentacles.

### How To Make a Tarot Deck out of Two Decks of Playing Cards and a Permanent Marker

Tarot decks can be quite expensive. Regular playing cards, on the other hand, can be acquired at
any gas station.

#### From one deck of cards:
* Write "0 / The Fool" on one of the two provided jokers.
* remove the other provided joker, and all "rules of draw & stud poker" style inserts.

#### From the other deck of cards
* take the Queens, cross out the Qs, and write "P" nearby, to make Pages in each suit.
* on 20 of the remaining cards, preferring cards with lots of _space_, cross out the suit and rank ("2 diamonds")
* Write in:
* 1 / The Magician
* 2 / The High Priestess
* 3 / The Empress
* 4 / The Emperor
* 5 / The Hierophant
* 6 / The Lovers
* 7 / The Chariot
* 8 / Strength
* 9 / The Hermit
* 10 / Wheel of Fortune
* 11 / Justice
* 12 / The Hanged Man
* 13 / Death
* 14 / Temperance
* 15 / The Devil
* 16 / The Tower
* 17 / THe Star
* 18 / The Moon
* 19 / The Sun
* 20 / Judgement
* 21 / The World
* Somewhere memorable, write: "Clubs -> Wands, Spades -> Swords, Hearts -> Cups, Diamonds -> Pentacles"
* Add the Pages and the newly created Major Arcana to the first deck. Remove the remaining cards.
* The final deck should have 78 cards in it.

## Content Warning

This game features _teenagers dying_. Like, quite a bit and fairly unavoidably.

Beyond that, the content of the game is going to be largely a conversation with
your GM. Be sure to familiarize yourselves with the [Safety Tools](./safety.md).

## Disclaimer Vis-a-Vis Occult Shenanigans

This game features ideas and elements of cartomancy, astrology, and esoteric
occult beliefs which are not taken terribly _seriously_.

If you are a deep believer in these concepts, either out of religious aversion
to them, or spiritual attraction to them, elements of this game may not
be up your alley.
