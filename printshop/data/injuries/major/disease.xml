* Disease can not be healed or improved by common AID checks: you must seek professional medical attention.
* Any time a Five of Pentacles is drawn:
   * If in Combat: take 8HP of damage. This damage can not be offset with Shields.
   * If outside of Combat: take a Minor Injury of the GM's choice.
* Take 4 Corruption Points to instantly heal Disease.
