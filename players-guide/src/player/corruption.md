# Corruption Points

In Remaining Teenagers: Zero, your character can die from taking too much physical damage, but that's
much less likely than your character _becoming something awful and otherworldly_.

Throughout the adventure, you will gain Corruption Points.

As you gain Corruption Points, you can allocate them to various places on your character sheet. In exchange, you'll unlock exciting new powers! Of course, _using_ these exciting new powers will just accelerate your Corruption.

When you don't have anywhere else on your character sheet to add a Corruption Point? Well.
Well that's quite bad.
