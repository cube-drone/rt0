## Swords
<!--
Swords are strong against the Heirophant (traditionalist, authoritarian tendencies)
and weak against the Magician (thought and mastery) -
which, I guess, means that they have some armor-piercing/armor-reduction but take extra damage from magic?

### The Executare
"Executive Luxury Private Security & Enforcement" is a mouthful of a company name, which is
why its private security squad are colloquially deemed "The Executare", a name derived from
a much more insulting and inappropriate name that will not be printed in this document.
In their employee manual they are instructed to always use the term "Executive Luxury
Private Security & Enforcement" in full, but even the Executare have taken to calling themselves
Executare when they're not around superiors - it's just easier.

The enforcement arm of Moon Unit Zappa, the Executare are putatively responsible for keeping
the peace on the Moon.

You'll know them from their crimson utility shirts, blue gloves, and belts well-stocked with
various and sundry weapons - tasers, batons, and pepper spray. They _would_ all carry firearms
were it not for a handful of incidents early in the moon's history where a suddenly depressurized
corner of Moon Unit Zappa claimed dozens of lives. Many still carry firearms, anyways.

Most of the Executare believe that the Moon is controlled by a fanciful conspiracy called
"The Ouroborous", and regard anything with a circle on it a sign of the
presence of The Ouroborous.

Their insignia is a pair of crossed swords.

Chosen for their impressive physique and authoritarian tendencies, Executare demand immediate
deference in all situations and brutally, physically punish those who do not swiftly comply.

### The Terror
The supernatural horror that grows in the hearts of the Executare is The Terror.

Most Terrors have the appearance of small shadow creatures, each of them an inky black silhouette
with the body of a child, pierced through with swords. Terrors are vicious, cruel, cowardly,
and ultraviolent.

Terrors are obsessed with strength, purity, tradition, and absolute conformity. The only art they condone
is art depicting iconography of The Executare: swords, lightning, knights, fighting.

Swords are the suit of intellect, challenge, and conflict, and The Terror is nurtured in the
hearts of Moon citizens who are too cowardly or dull to face their fears
or think through things, clearly, for themselves.

Most of the Executare harbor The Terror;
if their host is killed or sufficiently provoked they will cut their way out of their flesh shells
to try to deal with the problem on their own.

Their goal, broadly, is to spread by making people afraid of more and more things.

### Chariot
Cmdr. Gerald Yacht, Commander-in-chief and CEO of Executive Luxury Private Security & Enforcement.

A vain little dictator in a hoverchair.

He delivers speeches on the MUZ television system stoking fear, targeting ethnic groups,
kids' trends and non-Christian lifestyles as degeneracy wilting the roots of society.
He concocts and invents fantastical conspiracies targeting Good Regular Folk.
He's consistently putting up impressive numbers of imprisonments and executions
 of his current scapegoat-du-jour for society's ills.

He sees pedophiles and junkies wherever he looks, and he looks everywhere.


## Cups
<!--
Cups are generally weak against all of the Arcana, there are just a lot of them,
so players with lots of block (The Hierophant) and AoE effects are going to do better in Cups-heavy battles.
-->

### The Anonymous
They are traffic, they are the people in front of you in line, they are _everybody_.

The largest faction on the Moon, they are everyone, and everywhere. They wear mostly grey.

Many of the Anonymous work a day job somewhere on the moon, head home to a small cubby that they call home,
and watch television until the day is over. Many of them can go days or even weeks without experiencing
one moment of genuine human interaction.

If you have a dramatic battle in the middle of a train station, huge groups of The Anonymous will be
walking by, just trying to get to work, headphones in, pretending as hard as they can
to ignore what's going on.

### Legion

Utterly harmless individually, The Anonymous can become legitimately dangerous when there are lots of them
in the same place. Riled up by changes to their routine or threats to their schedule, The Anonymous
will give their hearts over to Legion to form a writhing, heaving, grasping mass of bodies, towering high
and crushing anything in its path.

Cups are the suit of emotions, relationships and intuition, and the anonymous are created when
people close themselves off to these things.

### The Hermit

Herman Ito, reclusive billionaire. A small, old man with round sunglasses.
Owner of, among others, Itophonic Headphones, Ito Getaways, ItoVR,
He wasn't the face of the Moon Unit Zappa project, but he was always
the financial backing. His goal was to completely insulate himself from humanity, to create a sanctuary
where nobody could harm him, bother him, or even appear on his radar.

His service staff are myriad and tuned exactly to his preferences.


## Pentacles

### The Company

Moon Unit Zappa was originally formed by WorldWide, but it is not operated as a total monopoly:
a small consortium of companies are allowed to operate and compete on the Moon.

In a large sense there is no _real_ government on the moon: only the negotiations of the consortium
boards and CEOs.

### The Ravenous

Unbearably fat demons with coins for eyes, they can eat anything: metal, vehicles, walls - anything.

Coins are the suit of materialism, finances, and practicality - but when their accumulation becomes


### The Devil

WorldWide CEO and charismatic frontwoman Lucy Ferrina.

### Temperance

## Wands

### The System

The democratic government of Moon Unit Zappa has been cordoned off to one co-operatively owned company,
"System for Democracy, Freedom, and Open Source Software", SYSDFOSS, that argues amongst itself ineffectually in a loop, seemingly eternally, and which rarely accomplishes anything.

SYSDFOSS has been made broadly responsible for filling in the cracks of society left by the large
companies. Someone has to feed and house the homeless and sick: this responsibility falls to SYSDFOSS,
and they are _in no way_ up to the task.

Often, the Moon will have a paid way to do something, like "sleep" or "eat", that is fast, convenient,
and expensive/exploitative, as well as a SYSDFOSS way to do something, which is difficult, arcane,
and only sometimes more reasonably priced. For example, the processes necessary to access a SYSDFOSS
food bank take up to six months to complete and require comprehensive proof of no other viable source of food.
Surviving long enough without food to access the SYSDFOSS food bank _legitimately_ is, of course,
completely impossible.

The bureaucratic procedures necessary for SYSDFOSS to accomplish _anything_ seem insurmountably
complicated and self-referential.

As for the many technological marvels promised by Moon Unit Zappa to turn the Moon into a utopian
society? Most of them don't work terribly well. Even corporate technology is prone to constant
malfunction, but SYSDFOSS technology rarely works at all.

### The Ouroborous

They legitimately do not exist. They are a fantasy cooked up by the Executare.
Circles are everywhere because circles are a _commonly used shape_.
