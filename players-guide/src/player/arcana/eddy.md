# ED - Eddy

Eddy is not so much a chooseable, playable major arcana as they are a temporary character, intended
for players who maybe only intend to stay for a single session, or for players who've died and
would like to participate in the rest of the session as a temporary character.

The GM is encouraged to have an Eddy or two tucked away, for a rainy day.

Eddy is a friendly robot who bumbles along and helps out the players.

Eddies are sentient and cheerfully desire to help out, but bumbling.

Eddy is a nickname: Eddy's full name is Ed25519, but they go by "Eddy" for short.

Eddy is not the only "Eddy" - there are dozens of Eddy-class robots who might stop in and help the players out.

## Skills

Each Eddy can choose only one Skill. That Skill is related to the automated task they perform around Paradise Lua.

## Shared Deck

You may not have enough tarot decks to support all Eddies: for this reason, none of their abilities are deck-modifying. They can just draw cards from the DM deck.

## Combat

Combat scaling doesn't apply to Eddies: if there are 3 players and 2 Eddies, the combat should be designed for 3 players.

Eddies are nonthreatening and Adversaries won't target them unless no other targets are available.

Eddies have 20 Hit Points, like players do.

In every combat phase, Eddies go before players, draw a 5 card hand, and can play _only two cards out of the five_, discarding
the other three.

### Any Card:
* Move 1 zone.

### Sword or Wand:
* Deal 2 melee damage.

### Cup or Pentacle:
* Gain 2 shields, OR give another player in the same zone 2 shields.

### Major Arcana:
*

### Tower:
* Explode, dealing 5 magic ranged damage to everyone, friend or foe, in the same zone.
* Take 20 Hit Points of damage.

### High Priestess:
* Reveal an Adversary's Intent, if it's hidden.

### The Hierophant:
* Choose a player: they may draw an extra card.

### The Chariot:
* Move to any position on the map.

## There's Always More Eddies

If an Eddy is destroyed (either in combat or as a result of poor decision making in a non-combat scene), an essentially
identical Eddy will roll up in the next scene (after the combat, or in the next room) and introduce themself to the players.

_"Hi, I'm Eddy 2!"_

_"Hi, I'm Eddy 3!"_
