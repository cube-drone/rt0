# Airlock & EVA

You enter through the airlock. It's the first thing that you encounter on Paradise Lua.

On their first time through Airlock & EVA, players are quickly ushered out and through, and don't get a chance to fully
explore it as much as they would like.

Even if they do return, the airlock has security safeguards out the actual wazoo: PortSec won't let them back out
to the Airlock, and even if they do, there are systems in place to keep random citizens from walking out
into space.
