# 4 - The Emperor

**Masculinity, Fatherhood, Structure, Authority, Tyranny, Side-Eye, The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, Uncomfortable Chairs**

Before you come at me for enforcing rigid gender roles, let me explain: the deck is more than a hundred years old. So femininity is portrayed as nurturing and nature-oriented and motherly, and masculinity is ramrod stiff, authoritarian, and militaristic.

Where the Empress appears to comfortably and effortlessly manage her pleasant forest kingdom with kindness and bounty, the Emperor is a bastard-coated bastard ruling an unpleasant mountain range with an iron fist. He's old, and shrewd, and seems a little worried that he might have forgotten to oppress someone.

This is the card of masculinity, good and bad. At its best: stoic, compassionate, protective, self-sacrificing, and a little goofy. At its worst: violent, misogynistic, angry, entitled, and nihilistic.
