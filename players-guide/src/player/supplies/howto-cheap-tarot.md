Tarot decks can be _pricey_.

## How To Make a Tarot Deck With Two Decks of Playing Cards and a Permanent Marker

Tarot decks can be quite expensive. Regular playing cards, on the other hand, can be acquired at
any gas station.

### From one deck of cards:
* Write "0 / The Fool" on one of the two provided jokers.
* remove the other provided joker, and all "rules of draw & stud poker" style inserts.

### From the other deck of cards
* Take the Queens, cross out the Qs, and write "P" nearby, to make Pages in each suit. (You may also consider drawing moustaches on them.)
* on 20 of the remaining cards, preferring cards with lots of _space_, cross out the suit and rank ("2 diamonds")
* Write in:
* I / The Magician
* II / The High Priestess
* III / The Empress
* IV / The Emperor
* V / The Hierophant
* VI / The Lovers
* VII / The Chariot
* VIII / Strength
* IX / The Hermit
* X / Wheel of Fortune
* XI / Justice
* XII / The Hanged Man
* XIII / Death
* XIV / Temperance
* XV / The Devil
* XVI / The Tower
* XVII / The Star
* XVIII / The Moon
* XIX / The Sun
* XX / Judgement
* XXI / The World
* Somewhere memorable, write: "Clubs -> Wands, Spades -> Swords, Hearts -> Cups, Diamonds -> Pentacles"
* Add the Pages and the newly created Major Arcana to the first deck. Remove the remaining cards.
* The final deck should have 78 cards in it.
