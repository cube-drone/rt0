# IV - The Emperor

The Emperor is meant to be a symbol of paternal energy, but I think
that the thing a lot of readers fail to miss about paternal energy
is how goofy and irreverant it can be.

The Emperor wants to take you fishing and show you how to build a
deck. The Emperor will invent silly songs to cheer you up when
you're feeling down.

themes:
* fishing, baseball, barbeque
* when friends are very threatened, goes into Max Damage mode / Papa Bear
