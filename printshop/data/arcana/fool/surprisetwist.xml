   * If the card drawn was Death, deal 150 Magic Ranged Damage.
   * If the card drawn was the Wheel of Fortune, draw and discard three additional cards and apply the Surprise Twist / Throwaway Joke effects to them, as well.

   * If the card drawn was The World, heal every Ally's HP to full and take 1 Corruption Point.
