# Items

### Backpack
_This sturdy rucksack is perfect for whatever you need to carry._

* In combat, draw and place a card from the top of your deck into the Backpack.
* If the card is The Tower, draw a new card and shuffle The Tower back into your deck.
* Any time during your turn, you may swap a card in your hand with the card on Backpack.

### Groucho Glasses
_The large plastic nose, glasses, and bushy eyebrows, together, make you look like
    a totally different person. The only problem is that that totally different
    person looks like they are wearing a toy on their face, but hey, it's a start._

Exhaust to gain Bonus on a DRAMA check.

### Blank Keycard
_A keycard that can be programmed to open any door._

* Reduce the difficulty of a FREE check made _to open a door_ by 1, then Exhaust Blank Keycard.

### Cast Iron Pan
_A large, heavy, black, cast iron pan. As effective against foes as it is against eggs._

* Reduce the difficulty of a SHOP check made _to make food edible or water potable_ by 1.
* When using Unarmed Strike, you may deal +1 damage.
* "Weapon" effects like this do not stack: only the highest damage bonus applies.

### EVA Suit
_It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but neither is depressurizing your lungs._

* This suit allows you to go outside of Paradise Lua without _immediately dying_.
* Wearing the EVA Suit _in_ Paradise Lua is surprisingly beneficial in combat situations:
   * The suit is covered in a thick armored poncho and steel helmet, granting you 3 Shields on every combat turn.
   * The helmet is airtight, and has its own oxygen supply, rendering you invulnerable to gas and liquid-based attacks.
* All skill checks except for FINAID made _while wearing the EVA Suit_ are made with Penalty: it's hard to move around in this thing.
* Putting on the EVA Suit in Combat takes a full round and a successful Medium GYM check.

### First Aid Kit
_This kit contains bandages, antiseptic, sterile gauze, scissors, and other supplies for treating minor injuries._

* Reduce the difficulty of an AID check made _to treat an injury_ by 1 step, then Exhaust First Aid Kit.

### Headphones
_These large, foamy, deluxe, bass-forward noise-cancelling headphones are exactly what you need to drown out Paradise Lua._

* After succeeding at a FINAID check (empathy, perception, or danger sense), but before finding out the results,
    you may instead fail the check.
* If you do:
   * Take the card that you succeeded the check with, and place it face-down on Headphones.
   * Headphones can hold up to 3 cards.
* At the start of combat:
   * Reveal all cards on Headphones and add them to your hand.
* Headphones can also be used to make a loud place quiet (perhaps allowing for a more restful sleep).

### Morning Start
_With taurine, ginseng, caffeine, amphetamines, and a little bit of our proprietary Formula X,
        Morning Start is the perfect way to start your day. Get in the Morning Start habit!_

* Draw 5 cards.
* Exhaust Morning Start.
* If you have the "Groggy" Minor Injury, remove it.
* If you do not have the "Morning Start Withdrawal" Minor Injury, take it.

### Trash Can Lid
_You can use it as an impromptu shield, or also to keep raccoons out of your trash._

* Gain 10 Shields.
* Exhaust Trash Can Lid

### Travel Pots
_Small, aluminum pots with lids that can be used to boil water or cook food._

* Reduce the difficulty of a SHOP check made _to make food edible or water potable_ by 1.
