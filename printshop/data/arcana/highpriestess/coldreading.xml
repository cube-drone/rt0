* You may play a card on Cold Reading at any time during your turn: when you do:
   * Choose two of Strong, Fast, Lucky, Charming, and Clever:
   * Palm Reading acts as if you **also** had these traits.
   * However, if you draw The Tower or The Moon, take 1 Corruption Point.
* You may discard the card on Cold Reading at any time. This cancels the above effect.

As a small extra clarification, players might attempt to lawyer the order of turn operations
such that drawing The Tower or The Moon
with Cold Reading active
would not cause the Corruption Point to be taken. ("well, if The Tower discards the card from Cold Reading automatically...")
This is some Magic: The Gathering level bullshit and is not the intent of the card. If you draw The Tower or The Moon, you take
the Corruption Point.
