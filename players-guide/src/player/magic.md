# Magic
Every player starts the game with 1 spell, except for **Dull** players,
who start the game with no spells and cannot learn spells.

Once a spell is chosen, no other players can choose that spell.

The set of spells that no player has chosen remains in the game: some effects take advantage of the set of unchosen spells.
