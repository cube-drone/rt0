# 15 - The Devil

**Addiction, Dependency, Excess**

These two forgot to use [Temperance](./14_temperance.md) and now they've
become hopelessly addicted to something. Wealth, power, or, heck, just
an addictive drug. Who knows what it is, but they're trapped, now!

These two look an awful lot like the two bright-eyed [lovers](./6_the_lovers.md).
Their relationship has become toxic and co-dependent and now they're stuck in it.

Look, The Devil isn't a cheery, fun-times card. It's a card for folks who have
been imprisoned by their own desires. Maybe they're working a job that they hate
because it's lucrative, or maybe they're caught in an endless cycle of chemical
dependency.

It's often a contract. There's something thematically very appropriate about it
being a contract. The Devil is, of course, in the details.
