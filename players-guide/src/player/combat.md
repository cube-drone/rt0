# Combat
Combat is triggered any time the players get into a scuffle with an adversary or adversaries.

The goal of Combat is to hit your opponent until they stop fighting.

## The Order
A Round of battle is a cycle where every participant gets one turn.

The Round is divided into three Periods.

In the Fast Period, all Fast players act, then all Fast adversaries act.
In the Middle Period, all players who aren't Fast or Slow act, then all adversaries who aren't Fast or Slow act.
In the Slow Period, all Slow players act, then all Slow adversaries act.

If the team has more than one Fast player or there are more than one Fast adversary, they
can choose which order to take their turns.

## A Turn

On a turn, a player draws 4 cards from their deck. If there are not enough cards in their deck
to draw 5 cards, they shuffle their discard pile into their deck, and then draw 4 cards from their deck.

These 5 cards constitute the player's "hand" for the turn.

### Probability Notes

## The Gutter
Every player has The Gutter, a collection of Default Abilities:

### Unarmed Strike
Place Minor Arcana cards of suit Wands or Swords on Strike.
Cards sitting on Strike remain there.
When the sum of the numerical values on the cards reaches (or exceeds) 13, discard all cards on Strike and deal 5 damage.

If Strong, 7 damage.
If Weak, 3 damage.

### Defend
Place Minor Arcana cards of suit Cups or Pentacles on Defend.
Cards sitting on Defend remain there.
When the sum of the numerical values on the cards reaches (or exceeds) 13, discard all cards on Defend and generate 5 defense.

If Fast, 7 shields.
If Slow, 3 shields.

### Concentrate
Place Major Arcana on Concentrate.
When there are two cards on Concentrate, discard them and draw a new card, immediately.

If Wise, when there are 1 cards on Concentrate.
If Foolish, when there are 3 cards on Concentrate.

### Discard Pile
Once there are >= 20 cards in the Discard pile, the Discard pile is shuffled back into the deck.

### The Tower
When The Tower is drawn, it must be played on The Tower, immediately.
The player discards all cards on all of their Abilities, including The Tower, then shuffles the discard pile back into their deck.

### Movement
???

### Skill Checks
Some actions during battle call for Skill Checks. "I hack the computer while the battle is raging on", or "I force open the door".

This costs cards from the player's hand, and the GM can determine how many cards it costs based on how time-consuming or distracting
the action might be. A very time consuming and distracting action, like hacking a computer, might cost all 4 cards,
whereas a quick action where the battle is still the focus, like deftly leaping across a chasm, might only cost 1 card.
