* While you are in combat, you lose 3HP at the beginning of your turn.
* Outside of combat, you can't use Skills except for AID.
* A successful Hard AID (First Aid) check can downgrade this to Bandaged Wound.
* This check can be retried.
* After one night of rest, the player dies.
* That's right, don't go to sleep while you're bleeding out. You need medical attention.
* That's _free medical advice_.
* Take 4 Corruption Points to instantly heal Bleeding Out.
