# The Surface of The Moon

**Nine of Swords**

Look, the players shouldn't go here. Not until near the very end of the story.
The Airlock is designed to keep them out.

But there's a chance that they're going to discover, in the records, what's out there
on the surface of the Moon, and they're going to put on EVASuits and go bouncing out
there to try and fight it.
