    <description>
* Any time The Tower is drawn, it must be played immediately and before any other cards: on Catastrophe.
* The player discards all cards on all of their abilities, including The Tower, then shuffles the discard pile back into their deck and ends their turn.
* If Lucky, gain 10 Shield.
