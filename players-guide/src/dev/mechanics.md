# Mechanics

The goal of the game is for each player to survive to the end of the school year.

This _should be easy_: most combat interactions are not fatal.

Every week is on a timer: the players have 7 days. At the end of the 7 days, one student must die.
One of their co-students goes crazy and embraces their corruption, building to a big boss fight.
If the players can defeat the Corruption Monster _and_ help the co-student work through their issues, their life can be saved.

Skill checks to resolve non-combat issues.
Combat, at least once per day. If players return to Class without having triggered a fight, OK Computer will generate one.

players need to manage:
* Exploration
* The Mystery of the Moonbase
* HP (in combat)
* Corruption Points (all the time)
* Abilities & Spells (they select some at the beginning of the game, and find more as they go)
* Injuries (what happens when HP gets to 0, or bad things happen to them during Exploration)
* Mutations (what happens when Corruption gets to 10)
* Position (Melee, Ranged, Flying)
* Items
* Hunger (they need to eat once a day)
* Sleep (they need to sleep every night)

If players don't eat for a day, they take 2 Corruption Points at the end of the day. The next day, the cost doubles.
If players don't sleep for a night, they take 2 Corruption Points at the beginning of the next morning. The next day, the cost doubles.
