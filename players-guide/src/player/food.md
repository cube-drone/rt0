## Eating

Some food is just _always edible_: like, "apples" or "boxed crackers" or "hamburgers from the food court".
You can pretty much always eat apples.

Some food is inedible until prepared: like, "flour", "raw meat", or "raw eggs". These foods need to be cooked, necessitating a SHOP (culinary) check, and only becomes edible if the SHOP (culinary) check succeeds.

Eating food that isn't edible, but is still _food_, like raw eggs or handfuls of loose flour, count as successfully Eating but will give you the Upset Stomach Minor Injury.

## Sleeping

If you find a place to sleep that isn't _safe_, you're going to trigger a (potential combat) scenario with some security bots or executare who's job it is to move itinerants along. This night's sleep won't be restful.

If you find a place to sleep that's loud, or distracting in some other way, your sleep won't be restful.

If you don't find a resful place to sleep, this counts as successfully Sleeping but will give you the Groggy Minor Injury.
