    <description>
* Place one card of each suit on Rabbit Out of a Hat
* Cards sitting on Rabbit Out of a Hat remain there.
* When all four cards are present:
   * Discard the lowest three cards
   * Draw the the highest ranked card into hand, and, for the rest of the turn, treat it as The Magician (for example, to trigger a spell).
