# Corruption Points

In Remaining Teenagers: Zero, your character can die from taking too much physical damage, but that's
much less likely than your character _becoming something awful and otherworldly_.

As you gain Corruption Points, you can allocate them to various places on your character sheet. In exchange, you'll unlock exciting new powers! Of course, _using_ these exciting new powers will just accelerate your Corruption.
