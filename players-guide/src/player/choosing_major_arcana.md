# Choosing a Major Arcana

Players each choose a major arcana that resonates with them.

This is like choosing a Class in a class-based RPG: your Major Arcana represents the broad archetype
into which your player fits, and provides a variety of abilities and skills within that archetype.

The Major Arcana available to the players are:

* [The Fool](./arcana/0_the_fool.md) - A class clown. Carefree. Naive. Random.
* [The Magician](./arcana/1_the_magician.md) - A mastermind spellcaster who always has a plan.
* [The High Priestess](./arcana/2_the_high_priestess.md) - A fortuneteller who can see into the future.
* [The Empress](./arcana/3_the_empress.md) - A mama bear who hits like a truck when her allies are in danger.
* [The Emperor](./arcana/4_the_emperor.md) - A charismatic leader with socks, sandals, and a wallet full of utility skills.
* [The Hierophant](./arcana/5_the_hierophant.md) - A bookish nerd who's armor is his speed.
* [The Lovers](./arcana/6_the_lovers.md) - An inseparable pair who are thick as thieves.
