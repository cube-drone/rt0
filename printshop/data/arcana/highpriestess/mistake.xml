* Play any five-card straight on A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected.
* These cards must all be played at the same time.
    * Sum the cards's values: deal half that much Magic Damage, rounded down, to all Adversaries in your Zone.
    * Discard all cards on A Mistake Will Soon Be Corrected.
    * If the five cards are not all in the same suit, take 1 Corruption Point and deal 1HP of Magic Damage to yourself and any allies in your Zone.
    * If the five cards are all Major Arcana, deal full Magic Damage rather than half.

<extraDescription>
* Just to clarify, a five-card straight is five cards in strict numerical order, like "2, 3, 4, 5, 6" or "10, Page, Knight, Queen, King".
* A straight can also be made out of the Major Arcana, but only if they are in strict numerical order.
* Wrap-around is not allowed, so "King, Ace, 2, 3, 4" is not a straight.
