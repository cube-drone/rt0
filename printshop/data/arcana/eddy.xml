Eddies are little semi-autonomous, remote-controlled robots that pepper the station,
doing their best to help wherever they can.

Eddies can not operate outside of the station: their bodies are remote controlled and
actually fairly disposable - which is good, because the station is dangerous and Eddies
are not terribly smart.
