* Place any "3" on Three Card Monte
* Draw three cards face-down from your deck. Hand them to the GM.
* The GM will show you one card, then mix it with the other two.
* Choose one of the three cards. If it is the card you saw, you may add it to your hand, treating it as a Magician.
* If it is not the card you saw, add it to your hand.
* Shuffle the other two cards back into your deck.
