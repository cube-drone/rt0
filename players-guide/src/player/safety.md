# Safety Tools & Session Zero

// go mimic some useful safety rules from sources that have good ones

// session zero: go over safety rules and create characters

// some notes on gender in tarot: tl;dr "boy empress totally ok", "masculine aspect" doesn't necessitate "biologically male", obvs the same for feminine, most cards are neutral anyways
