I'm pretty sure she stole the pomegranate sheet behind The High Priestess and turned it
in to a dress. She's a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world.

(I believe that) Femininity is a cultural construct rather than a _real thing that exists_.
The Empress is built out of all of the stuff in the bucket marked "girl", good or bad.
That doesn't necessarily mean "biologically female" but it certainly means "culturally female" for all that entails:
she's soft, she's hot, she's motherly, she's nurturing, and she's brought entirely too much luggage into the forest with her.

At her worst? She's catty, vapid, and vain. She's confused "self-care" for "utter solipsism". She's a rigid and inflexible defender of
the gender binary and polices both "maleness" and "femaleness". She's looking for a man in finance; trust fund, 6'5", blue eyes.
She wears a short skirt and a long jacket. Her social network of moms don't believe in MMR shots (nor does she know what "MMR" stands for),
and as a result are now trying to treat a growing measles epidemic with turmeric and lemon juice. She won't eat carbs and she steams all of
her vegetables - because she heard that roasting adds calories. [She drinks eight glasses of water a day, and she's not
entirely sure why, except that someone said, one time, that that was how much water she was supposed to drink](https://theweek.com/articles/460728/where-did-8glassesofwateraday-myth-come-from).
She's on a juice cleanse. Her purse cost more than a commuter sedan. She has watched every single episode of The Real Housewives of True Crime.

At her best? She's creative, caring, free-spirited, effortlessly beautiful, and connected with herself, others, and nature itself.
She's made you soup and brought you a blanket, because you're sick. She takes care of the people around her.
She's a whole social network in one person.
Everywhere she touches feels more like home. She wants you to call because she just wants to know that you're okay.
She started a garden. She has recipes on index cards. She brought a granola bar for the road. She's a mama bear, fierce and protective.
She's organized. She can dance. She's none of these things if she doesn't want to be.
She's deeply uninterested in _my_ perception of what constitutes stereotypical femininity
and instead chooses to define it on her own terms.

### Warning!
It's probably wise to consider leaving The Empress out of your games: there are lots of ways that portraying a character as
"archetypally female" could result in hurt feelings, especially without direct lived experience. Hell, it was probably unwise
to include _this page, as written_ in the card index.
