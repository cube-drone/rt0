Herman Ito, reclusive billionaire. A small, old man with round sunglasses.
Owner of, among others, Itophonic Headphones, Ito Getaways, ItoVR,

His goal was to completely insulate himself from humanity, to create a sanctuary
where nobody could harm him, bother him, or even appear on his radar.

His service staff are myriad and tuned exactly to his preferences.
