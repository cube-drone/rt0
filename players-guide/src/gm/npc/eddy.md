# Eddies

[Eddies](../../player/arcana/eddy.md) are little semi-autonomous, remote-controlled robots that pepper the station,
doing their best to help wherever they can.

Eddies can not operate outside of the station: their bodies are remote controlled and
actually fairly disposable - which is good, because the station is dangerous and Eddies
are not terribly smart.

Their initial digital imprint was built on an architecture that attempted to model the brain
of a 12-year old Golden Retriever named "Sunny", and it was remarkably successful: as a result,
the Eddies are unbelievably friendly, helpful, and self-sacrificing. They are also not
_that much_ smarter than a regular Golden Retriever with opposable thumbs and the ability to speak.

The Eddy network has been infiltrated by The Sun, who seeks, with varying levels of success,
 to corrupt the borderline uncorruptable Eddies with its toxic positivity and dubious helpfulness.

If you draw a Sun in relation to an random event on the base, a bunch of Eddies show up. To "help".

## The Sun

The Sun is the closest True Horror to humanity. It literally lives in Sol, the sun, and it's fascinated with humans.
It _loves_ humans. It wants to be best friends with humans. It wants to hold humans _so close_ and _never let go_.

The Sun is constantly bombarding The Earth and The Moon with _good vibes_ and _deadly radiation_.

The problem is, The Sun's attention is ... a lot. It hugs its toys to death, grieves very briefly, and
then moves on. Many cults erupted on Earth to worship The Sun, and the ones who successfully
made contact mostly died out, in ways that tended towards ironic wish-fulfillment from a friendly but
clueless god. One was crushed to death by a too-generous harvest.
Another had a heart attack after having too many sexual encounters in one evening.

The Sun is also the True Horror that it would cost the most for humanity to lose: without The Sun constantly bombarding
the entire solar system with positive mental energy, optimism, and love - well, these things would start to die out,
and humanity would simply tear itself apart at the hands of the other Horrors.
