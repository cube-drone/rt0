# Critical Injury

### Critical Injury
_Critical injuries are really bad._

* While your character has a Critical Injury, they can not move or deal damage. They can speak. They are incapacitated.
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to a Major Injury of the GM's choice.
* If a player receives another critical injury when they are critically injured, they die.
* Instead of dying, the player can (and probably should) take Corruption Points to heal injuries.
* Take 6 Corruption Points to instantly heal a Critical Injury.
