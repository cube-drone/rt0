* When the High Priestess is placed on YES NO, you may also:
   * Take 1 Corruption Point
   * After drawing the top five cards of your deck, but before you place the rest of the cards on top of your deck,
        you may choose to place The High Priestess on top of your deck.
   * (_So, just to be clear, the order there is "the cards in the order you chose" "the High Priestess" "the rest of the cards" "the cards you placed at the bottom of your deck"_)
   * Every other player may also perform the action of YES NO.

The visions aren't always contained: sometimes they spill out, causing a mass hallucination.
