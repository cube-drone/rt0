* Any time you take Damage, (even if offset with your Shield), you may say "Hit Me" to the GM.
   * Draw a card from the deck.
   * If it's a Minor Arcana, play it face-down on Blackjack.
   * If it's The Tower, take 1 Corruption Point _and_ discard all cards on Blackjack.
   * If it's a Major Arcana, discard it without playing it.
