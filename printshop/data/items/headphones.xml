* After succeeding at a FINAID check (empathy, perception, or danger sense), but before finding out the results,
    you may instead fail the check.
* If you do:
   * Take the card that you succeeded the check with, and place it face-down on Headphones.
   * Headphones can hold up to 3 cards.
* At the start of combat:
   * Reveal all cards on Headphones and add them to your hand.
* Headphones can also be used to make a loud place quiet (perhaps allowing for a more restful sleep).
