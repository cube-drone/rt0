## Candlelight Tryst
In order to help keep the fertility numbers of the station juiced, Candlelight Tryst is a
subsidised singles platform.

* Planned events and activities that shuffle people together at high speeds.
* Short term hotel pods that are _thoroughly_ cleaned.

## Home is Where The Heart Family Practice
Serious maladies are treated at Misericorde,
but family planning and pediatrics are provided closer to home at Home is Where The Heart.
Doctors A and B work together to (something something)

## The Chalice
Bar! Arcade! Casino!

## EDUK8
the education zone
children learn how to work the various jobs of Paradise Lua, directly from the companies
responsible!

## ADVERTISING! Complex
it's a mall? it's a mall!

## Overflow Slums
At any given time there are a few more people than homes, and they accumulate in the
Overflow Slums, where they are treated awfully.

## Habcube
For singles and the vast lower-middle class, tiny apartments with mostly shared facilities.

## Nuclear Family
These larger condominiums are meant to approximate American suburbs,
and accomodate larger families.

## Geriatridome
is where they pack the olds

## Page of Cups - The Conman
Me and my fish know what's up. This slick double-dealer always has an angle.

## Knight of Cups - The Knight of Love
Calm, cool, collected, and putting it all on the line for someone he loves.

## Queen of Cups - The Psychiatrist
Emotional stability.

Will serve a cup of tea and help you work through your complex emotions.

## King of Cups - The Diplomat
It's abundantly clear looking at this card that the King of Cups has just shat his pants and doesn't want anybody to know about it.

He's a deft politician, thoughtful and able to shift his position on a dime.
