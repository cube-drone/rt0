# Injuries & Healing

When players take HP damage in combat, they recover it as soon as the combat is resolved:
they might be scraped up but this is accounted for in the player's natural resilience.

However, if players hit 0HP, they immediately take a Major Injury of the GM's choice,
at which point they recover 15HP.

Some Adversaries can give the players injuries _directly_, as well as certain failed skill checks:
one might fail at preparing raw meat and end up with *Upset Stomach / Farts Ahoy!*.


## Minor

### Distracted
* A Distracted player must immediately discard all Wands or Pentacles drawn on their turn.
* Discard Distracted after Combat.

### Upset Stomach / Farts Ahoy!
* While you have Upset Stomach / Farts Ahoy!, take a Penalty on all skill checks.
* Discard Farts Ahoy! at the end of the day.

### Splinted Arm
* While you have a Splinted Arm, you cannot be `Strong`
* After one night of rest, mark Splinted Arm.
* After a second night of rest, remove Splinted Arm.

### Splinted Leg
* While you have a Splinted Leg, you cannot be `Fast`
* After one night of rest, mark Splinted Leg.
* After a second night of rest, remove Splinted Leg.

### Dizzy
* While you have Dizziness, you cannot be `Wise`
* After one night of rest, mark Dizzy.
* After a second night of rest, remove Dizzy.

### Loopy
* While you have Loopiness, you cannot be `Clever`
* After one night of rest, mark Loopy.
* After a second night of rest, remove Loopy.

### Hex
* While you have Hex, you cannot be `Lucky`
* After one night of rest, mark Hex.
* After a second night of rest, remove Hex.

### Stress
* While you have Stress, you cannot be `Charming`
* After one night of rest, mark Stress.
* After a second night of rest, remove Stress.

### Bandaged Wound
* While you are in combat, you lose 1HP/turn
* After one night of rest, mark Bandaged Wound.
* After a second night of rest, remove Bandaged Wound.

### Massive, Painful Scar
* It might be a physical or emotional scar, but either way it isn't going anywhere.
* You can have more than one Massive, Painful Scar.
* At the beginning of the day, cover one of your combat abilities with Massive, Painful Scar. It can not be used this day.
* A different combat ability can be chosen each day, but Massive, Painful Scar must always cover at least one ability.
* Two Massive, Painful Scars cannot cover the same ability.

## Major
If a player receives a second Major injury while they already have a Major Injury, instead give them
a Critical Injury.

Generally, the AID or MISC check to downgrade Major injuries to Minor ones is Hard, at least.

### Broken Arm
* While you have a Broken Arm, you are `Weak`.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Strong, now you are Weak).
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to a Splinted Arm.
* After one night of rest, mark Broken Arm.
* After a second night of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.

### Broken Leg
* While you have a Broken Leg, you are `Slow`.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Fast, now you are Slow).
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to a Splinted Leg.
* After one night of rest, mark Broken Leg.
* After a second night of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.

### Concussion
* While you have a Concussion, you are `Foolish`.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Wise, now you are Foolish).
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to Dizzy.
* After one night of rest, mark Concussion.
* After a second night of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.

### Delerium
* While you have Delerium, you are `Dull`, and you cannot cast spells.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Clever, now you are Dull).
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to Loopy.
* After one night of rest, mark Delerium.
* After a second night of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.

### Curse
* While you have Curse, you are `Unlucky`.
* This overrides any character traits you might already have (if you were Lucky, now you are Unlucky).
* Adjust your deck accordingly.
* A successful MISC check can downgrade this to Hex.
* After one night of rest, mark Curse.
* After a second night of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.

### Unresolved Trauma
* While you have Unresolved Trauma, you are `Repulsive`.
* If you have spells or abilities that can only be used if you are Charming, you can not use them.
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to Stress.
* After one night of rest, mark Unresolved Trauma.
* After a second night of rest, downgrade this to Massive, Painful Scar.

### Bleeding Out
* While you are in combat, you lose 3HP/turn
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to Bandaged Wound.
* After one night of rest, the player dies.
* That's right, don't _go to sleep_ while you're _bleeding out_. You need *medical attention*. That's _free medical advice_.

## Critical Injury
* While your character has a Critical Injury, they can not do _anything_.
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to Bleeding Out.
* If a player receives another critical injury when they are critically injured, they die.

## Using Corruption Points to Heal Injuries

* For 1 Corruption Point, a Minor Injury can vanish entirely.
* For 3 Corruption Points, a Major Injury can vanish entirely.
* For 4 Corruption Points, a Critical Injury can vanish entirely.

## Death
Death is entirely optional! Players can, of course, always take more corruption to avoid this unfortunate result.

The rules for player death are, unfortunately, only available to the GM.
Be assured, however, that this player character will no longer remain playable.
The amount of corruption the player has taken on _will_ be factored in.
