# The Adventure

Lots of RPG systems are designed to tell _any_ story. They're broad, flexible systems that
you can spend loads of time telling tale after tale in.

That's not RT:0. RT:0 has just the one story: this one. You can change it as much as you
like while running it for your friends, but (at least at time of writing), RT:0 is an
adventure that just comes with _just the one campaign_.

## The Four Act Structure
The main storyline is divided into four acts.

### Act 1: Joyeuse, Introduction to Paradise Lua
In this act, players are introduced to Paradise Lua and allowed to roam Joyeuse Division.

#### Touchdown
* Players touch down in the [Passenger Concourse](./locations/joyeuse/airlock.md#passenger-concourse),
    along with enough NPC teenagers to count up to 8.
* Are the players met by a delegation? X0XI? Eddies?

#### Initiation
* Next, Daybreak Institute.
* The First Combat.
* Food and Sleep, The Stipend System
   * (players are given a stipend for expenses and lodging, but it was established decades ago and uncontrolled for inflation, so it's worthless)
   * (the Daybreak Institute dorms are unsuitable for human habitation, and the Cafeteria does not produce edible food)
* Maybe "The First Combat" and "The Dorms are Unsuitable for Human Habitation" are the same event?

#### Quest
* True Horrors are attempting to infiltrate Paradise Lua
* Players must find citizens grappling with True Horrors and help them to balance their Horror.
* Temperance, The Hermit, and The Sun are allies?

* The introduction of the Magical MacGuffins: players must do X things to prevent the end of the world as we know it.

#### Act Break
* A "boss fight"
* The players get access to Krater Valley.

### Act 2: Krater, Things Seem Like They're Going Well

#### A Few Major and Minor Arcana Get Defeated By The Players
* Let the players explore a bit and get embroiled in their own nemeses.


### Act 3: Florin, Collapse
In this act, players gain access to the seat of Paradisa Lua's power, Florin,
just as the story hits its "darkest before the dawn".

* The Hanged Man reveals themselves and fully corrupts all of the other True Horrors.
* The Sun gets corrupted by The Hanged Man and the Sun itself _goes dark_, giving
   Paradise Lua maybe 48 hours on battery before it, too, goes dark.
* The Hanged Man is destroyed: Judgement is awakened.
* If The World wakes up, the universe itself will come to an end.


### Act 4: Nadir, Walk Backwards Into Hell, The Surface of the Moon
The final act.

Players start on the run and hopeless in a Paradise Lua that's much less hospitable
than even the horrible Paradise Lua from Act 1.

However: any of the hosts that they Saved in Acts 1, 2, and 3, they can shut down
their connection to their True Horrors, losing all powers but breaking The Hanged Man's
link to them, weakening Judgement.
