## True Horrors: The Psychic 26

The Moon is host to the attention of 26 ancient, impossibly distant psychic entities.
These are the True Horrors, each hoping to claw their way into the hearts and minds
of the people of the Moon.

These correspond with each of the 22 Major Arcana, as well as The Terror (Swords), The Ravenous (Pentacles),
 Legion (Cups), and The Bound (Wands).

Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere offers protection from cosmic radiation and all manner of
spaceborne harms, but it's Earth's billions of people who form a psychisphere, protecting humans from
psychic incursions: the only way for the True Horrors to gain access to the psychic feast that is Earth
is by first establishing a stronghold on the Moon.

True Horrors offer boons and benefits to the human hosts they bind to, but gradually take more and more
control of the host, until the host is nothing more than a meat-puppet for a distant True Horror.

Some of the True Horrors are _Infectuous_. They spread their power by creating circumstances that amplify their
effects on people's minds and claiming more and more victims. Currently, Legion is the _most_ infectious
and one of the _most widespread_ of the Horrors, but correspondingly their powers are some of the weakest.

Some of the True Horrors are _Insidious_. They prefer to spread their power by focusing on one specific individual,
growing their power by leaps and bounds inside a single host until they're enormously powerful, then erupting forth.
These are the kinds of True Horrors infecting our players.

Some True Horrors are _a little from Column A, a little from Column B_.

Some of them work together. Some of them want to destroy the others. Their goals are often at odds.
