# Choosing a Major Arcana

Players each choose a major arcana that resonates with them.

This is like choosing a Class in a class-based RPG: your Major Arcana represents the broad archetype
into which your player fits, and provides a variety of abilities and skills within that archetype.

The Major Arcana available to the players are:

* [The Fool](./arcana/0_the_fool.md) - A class clown. Carefree. Naive. Random.
* [The Magician](./arcana/1_the_magician.md) - A mastermind spellcaster who always has a plan.
* [The High Priestess](./arcana/2_the_high_priestess.md) - A fortuneteller who can see into the future.

_Look, while this game is still in a Rough Draft state, there are only a handful of playable Major Arcana. More to come._

The initial run of the Major Arcana used exactly the first six cards and included:

* The Empress (A mama bear who hits like a truck when her allies are in danger),
* The Emperor (A charismatic leader with socks, sandals, and a wallet full of utility skills)
* The Hierophant (A bookish nerd who's armor is his speed)

then, I thought those seemed boring and replaced them with:

* The Lovers (pairs)
* Strength (they brought a lion)
* * Death (???)

however, ultimately I'd like to make sure that the game feels balanced and playable with just the first three classes before I add any more.
