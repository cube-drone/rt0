# The Adventure

Lots of RPG systems are designed to tell _any_ story. They're broad, flexible systems that
you can spend loads of time telling tale after tale in.

That's not RT:0. RT:0 has just the one story: this one. You can change it as much as you
like while running it for your friends (or write whatever else you want),
but (at least at time of writing), RT:0 is an adventure that just comes with _just the one campaign_.

## The Four Act Structure
The main storyline is divided into four acts.

* [Act 1: Joyeuse, Introduction to Paradise Lua](./adventure/act1.md)
  * In this act, the players get into the flow of life on Paradise Lua
* [Act 2: Krater, Monster of the Week](./adventure/act2.md)
  * In this act, players hunt Major Arcana and make good progress.
* [Act 3: Florin, Collapse](./adventure/act3.md)
  * In this act, the players seal their final Major Arcana, only for catastrophe to strike.
* [Act 4: Nadir, Walk Backwards Into Hell](./adventure/act4.md)
  * In this act, the players must well and truly save Paradise Lua, and all of mankind from Judgement.


### Act 2: Krater, Things Seem Like They're Going Well

#### A Few Major and Minor Arcana Get Defeated By The Players
* Let the players explore a bit and get embroiled in their own nemeses.


### Act 3: Florin, Collapse
In this act, players gain access to the seat of Paradisa Lua's power, Florin,
just as the story hits its "darkest before the dawn".

* The Hanged Man reveals themselves and fully corrupts all of the other True Horrors.
* The Sun gets corrupted by The Hanged Man and the Sun itself _goes dark_, giving
   Paradise Lua maybe 48 hours on battery before it, too, goes dark.
* The Hanged Man is destroyed: Judgement is awakened.
* If The World wakes up, the universe itself will come to an end.


### Act 4: Nadir, Walk Backwards Into Hell, The Surface of the Moon
The final act.

Players start on the run and hopeless in a Paradise Lua that's much less hospitable
than even the horrible Paradise Lua from Act 1.

However: any of the hosts that they Saved in Acts 1, 2, and 3, they can shut down
their connection to their True Horrors, losing all powers but breaking The Hanged Man's
link to them, weakening Judgement.


## Running A Smaller Version of the Campaign, or A One Shot
Just run Act 1?
