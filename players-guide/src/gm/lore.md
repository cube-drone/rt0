## Some Basic Moon Facts
* during the (almost) 15 day "day", the moon's supernatural effects are at their weakest, with their nadir at full moon
* during the (almost) 15 day "night", the moon's supernatural effects are at their strongest, with their apex at total darkness (new moon).
* the base is located at the resource-rich north pole which enjoys constant sunlight
* 16% of earth's gravity
* lunar soil provides oxygen
* lunar ice provides water
* ample solar power
* human shit and worms provide fertilizer
* loads of radiation on the surface
* because of the lack of atmosphere, weird temperatures, and high radiation, most of the base is located underground
* surface structures are often inflatable
* modern spacesuit designs have a wetsuit-like inner shell and a radation overcoat

## Time

A full moon "day" takes 1 Earth Month, which makes it not useful for human circadian rhythms, which is why the underground base has its own day/night cycle enforced with artificial lights, synchronized with their original home base in Las Vegas, Nevada (Pacific Standard Time).

Timekeeping on Paradise Lua is almost all done in 24-hour time.
