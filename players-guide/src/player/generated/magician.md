[Magician Character Sheet](/generated/printables/magician.html)

## Description

A resourceful, powerful schemer, The Magician has brought a binder full of detailed plans
that has color-coded tabs for every possible situation and outcome. Sometimes magic is just
someone spending more time on something than anybody else might reasonably expect. They're always prepared,
and they always have a trick up their sleeve. The Magician gets access to more spells, and more damaging spells,
than any other Arcana.

* The Magician can treat The Fool card as a second The Magician card.
* The Magician gains the Clever ability.
* The Magician learns one extra spell at the start of the game.
* Choose two of the The Magician's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: This Was All Part of My Plan
Once per Day, The Magician can have planned ahead, retroactively.

#### Planned Ahead, Retroactively?
* This means that The Magician can declare that they had a plan in place for a situation that has just arisen, and that they have already taken steps to prepare for it.
* This can include lots of things: having a piece of vital equipment on hand, or having bribed someone in advance.
* The GM can veto or negotiate this.

## Arcana Abilities
