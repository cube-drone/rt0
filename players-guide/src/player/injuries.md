# Injuries, Healing, and Death

When players take HP damage in combat, they recover it as soon as the combat is resolved:
they might be scraped up but this is accounted for in the player's natural resilience.

However, if players hit 0HP, they immediately take a Major Injury of the GM's choice,
at which point they recover 15HP.

Some Adversaries can give the players injuries _directly_, as well as certain failed skill checks:
one might fail at preparing raw meat and end up with *Upset Stomach / Farts Ahoy!*.

### Bleeding Out
* While you are in combat, you lose 3HP at the beginning of your turn.
* Outside of combat, you can't use Skills except for AID.
* A successful AID (First Aid) check can downgrade this to Bandaged Wound.
* After one night of rest, the player dies.
* That's right, don't _go to sleep_ while you're _bleeding out_. You need *medical attention*. That's _free medical advice_.

## Critical Injury
* While your character has a Critical Injury, they can not do _anything_.
* A successful AID check can downgrade this to Bleeding Out.
* If a player receives another critical injury when they are critically injured, they die.
* Instead of dying, the player can (and probably should) use Corruption Points to heal injuries.

## Using Corruption Points to Heal Injuries
At any time players can mark Corruption Points on their sheets to heal injuries:

* For 2 Corruption Points, a Minor Injury can vanish entirely.
* For 4 Corruption Points, a Major Injury can vanish entirely.
* For 6 Corruption Points, a Critical Injury can vanish entirely.

## Death
Death is entirely optional! Players can, of course, always take more corruption to avoid this unfortunate result.

The exact rules for player death are, unfortunately, only available to the GM.

Be assured, however, that this player character will no longer remain playable.

The amount of corruption the player has taken on _will_ be factored in.

## Full Corruption
Again, exactly what happens when there are no Corruption spaces left to fill on the character sheet remains a mystery,
for now (GM: It's explained in the GM's guide!), but presume that going far enough down this path will end up at a point where the character becomes no longer playable.

## Eddy, and Creating a New Player Character

If a player doesn't have access to a playable character for one reason or another
(Death, Full Corruption, heck, even simple unconsciousness or being trapped in a room somewhere), they can grab
 an [Eddy](./arcana/eddy.md). Eddy is a low-impact temporary player character designed for just such an occasion!

 If the player would like to continue, with a new Player Character, they must choose a new Major Arcana.

 A pod containing their player is _shot on to the moon_. If a NPC matching their arcana exists, that NPC is fated
 to die within the fortnight.
