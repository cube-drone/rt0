![the fool](/images/fool.png)

[Fool Character Sheet](/generated/printables/fool.html)

## Description

Lucky, reckless, unreliable, and full of surprises, The Fool is a wildcard, a class clown,
they don't take anything seriously. When luck is on their side - and it is, more often than not -
they're unstoppable, but when it's not, they're a disaster waiting to happen.

* The Fool can treat The Fool card as a true wildcard: any card they choose, in any situation.
* The Fool gains the Lucky ability.
* Choose two of The Fool's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: Deus Ex Machina
Once per Day, The Fool can request a Deus Ex Machina from the GM: The universe itself intervenes to provide a hint,
happy accident, fortuitous coincidence, or other stroke of unexpected luck.
