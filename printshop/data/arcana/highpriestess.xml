### Skill: Foresight

* The High Priestess has packed a wide variety of divinatory tools that - unlike for most - actually **work**.
   * Their Magic 8-Ball is surprisingly accurate.
   * Their Ouija Board can actually be used to communicate with spirits, if they're present.
   * Their Tarot Deck can be used to draw a card that actually represents details about their present or future situation.
   * Their Crystal Ball can show them limited visions of things happening around them or visions of the future.
   * They've a handful of Fortune Cookies which contain actual, useful situation-appropriate advice.
* In general, the High Priestess can use these tools to gain insight into the future, or to understand the present,
    but after using any individual tool, it is exhausted for the Day.
* The High Priestess can either request that the GM provide a result, or, they can
    provide their own result and ask the GM to make it come true.
* If the GM can't or won't (sometimes it's just not going to happen): the item is not exhausted for the Day.
