# A Brief Guide to the Tarot

While every Tarot deck includes a little booklet explaining the cards and their meanings and interpretations,
I have also included one here, for the sake of completeness.

A passing familiarity with some of this stuff may enhance the _thematic resonance_ of various elements of the
game.

## A Note on Cartomancy

It is, of course, possible to predict the future with startling specificity and accuracy. Astronomers do it
all the time: with access to a telescope the size of a building and a brain-melting amount of calculus,
it's possible to do things like predict the precise location of stars in the sky years in advance,
determine the time and location of future eclipses, and predict exactly when the sun will rise and set.

After thousands of years we've finally found a priesthood who, when **they** read the tea leaves,
_actually come out with the correct answer_. Absolutely bananas.
The prognostication olympics have been cancelled because ballistics team took home
every medal for 4 centuries straight. Astrology didn't even have a chance.

Technically, ballistics _should_ be able to tell you which pip
on a numbered die will come up when you roll the bones, or what the weather will be like tomorrow,
but when it comes down to complex systems like fluid, or even the bounces of a handful of small rocks,
chaos intervenes to make predictions essentially impossible: most things exist in systems
so complex that _ballistics calculations work, but microscopic changes in initial position and velocity
 produce wildly different outcomes_, so models can't reliably produce exact predictions.

Probability theory and statistics then stepped up to bat and firmly delivered a line drive for our
ability to predict the unpredictable. Despite being unable to predict the outcome of an individual die roll,
probability can accurately bound and predict the outcome of thousands of dice rolled together.
Roll a six-sided die 1,000,000 times
and I guarantee the sum of those dice will be more than 3,000,000, less than 4,000,000, and
a stone's throw away from 3,500,000. Probably.

We are, in fact, prediction engines, constantly engaged in the task of measuring, modelling and predicting our
surroundings. It would be impossible to participate in traffic, or to play a game of pool or poker,
if we weren't.

I say this in order to establish that predicting the future is, in fact, possible.
We do it all the time.

Cartomancy, however, depends on the well-understood practice of [cold reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading).
It's a carefully managed illusion whereby a clever huckster can attempt to predict _the past_, which,
generally, is much easier to predict than the future, on account of it's having already happened.

By presenting cards that offer seemingly-specific interpretations, but that can also be re-interpreted and
re-combined in various and sundry ways by exploiting their rich details and broad archetypes, cartomancy
offers an extremely powerful engine for cold reading. "The Lovers" and "The Emperor" together can mean
"you will fall in love with a tall, dark, handsome man within the week" (whoa, chills), but it can also mean
"you will have or have had a positive interaction with any man, at some point in the future or at any point in your past",
a prediction that, if you were simply to make it without the aid of fun occult-themed cards, would be
so non-specific and broadly applicable as to be laughable.

Cold readers watch their clients closely as they draw cards. If they gravitate towards specific cards, it's likely that
those are the ones that _have_ meaningful connotations for them.

Cold reading works by giving the target a lot of very broad patterns and then watching and refining, taking their
reaction to the patterns presented and using them to zero in on specific details. This is easier with a willing audience:
most people are happy to reinterpret vague statements into their own frame of reference and volunteer a lot
of information about themselves.

It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to see a Patagonia vest and a ten thousand dollar watch
and say "Your connection to the financial world brings you a lot of pain, but also provides welcome structure to your life".

It's also much easier to remember a spookily accurate prediction as a wild and unlikely coincidence, while
dismissing and quickly forgetting an inaccurate prediction... Ashley. Honestly, with enough customers and enough
predictions, you're bound to find someone who _you've always been right about_, just by accident.

This produces no shortage of "whoa" moments for people experiencing cartomancy for their first time. Whoa: Death came up,
and my grandfather _just died last week_. Or: if there wasn't a prominent death recently? Maybe there will be one in the
future. Or maybe there won't, and Death just meant "any significant change, at all".
Because the cards have _specific connotations_ but _general outs_, they're able to produce a high velocity of interpretations
that feel laser-precise even if they're... not, really.

This doesn't mean all fortunetellers are necessarily hucksters, _although many of them are_: many fortunetellers are simply
intuitive, empathetic people who are as invested in manufacturing the accuracy of their card readings as their customers are.
They've had many of their own "whoa" moments, and with a little effort they, too, can tune their _inner eye_.

Ultimately, it's my impression that fortunetellers are mostly harmless: talking over your life and experiences
with an empathetic stranger who's doing their best to _listen so well that they seem prescient_ can be
pleasant and even thereapeutic for many, although it's no substitute for real therapy.

This also leads to some fun life advice: toss out wild predictions now and then. People will forget the misses,
but remember the hits, and you'll seem like an oracle.
