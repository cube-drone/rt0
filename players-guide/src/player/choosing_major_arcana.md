# Choosing a Major Arcana

Players each choose a major arcana that resonates with them.

This is like choosing a Class in a class-based RPG: your Major Arcana represents the broad archetype
into which your player fits, and provides a variety of abilities and skills within that archetype.

The Major Arcana available to the players are:

* [The Fool](./arcana/0_the_fool.md) - A class clown. Carefree. Naive. Random.
* [The Magician](./arcana/1_the_magician.md) - A mastermind spellcaster who always has a plan.
* [The High Priestess](./arcana/2_the_high_priestess.md) - A fortuneteller who can see into the future.
* [The Lovers](./arcana/6_the_lovers.md) - An inseparable pair who are thick as thieves.
* [Strength](./arcana/8_strength.md) - They're strong, and they brought a pet!
* [Death](./arcana/13_death.md) -

_Ed: The initial run of the Major Arcana used exactly the first six cards and included The Empress (A mama bear who hits
like a truck when her allies are in danger), The Emperor (A charismatic leader with socks, sandals, and a wallet full of
utility skills), and The Hierophant (A bookish nerd who's armor is his speed) instead of The Lovers, Strength, and Death.
But actually "mom" and "dad" and "boring" as themes don't feel as fun? So instead I tried to pick out classes that
I felt would actually be exciting to play as. Future versions of RT:0 intend to introduce more playable classes._
