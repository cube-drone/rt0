# Swords

somehow? Swords are strong against the Heirophant and weak against the Magician -
which, I guess, means that they have some armor-piercing/armor-reduction but take extra damage from magic?

## Executare
The enforcement arm of Moon Unit Zappa, the Executare are putatively responsible for keeping
the peace.

You'll know them from their crimson utility shirts and blue gloves.
Their insignia is a pair of crossed swords.

Chosen for their impressive physique and authoritarian tendencies, Executare demand immediate
deference in all situations and brutally, physically punish those who do not swiftly comply.

## The Terror
The supernatural horror that grows in the hearts of the Executare is The Terror.

Most Terrors have the appearance of a small shadow creatures, each of them an inky black silhouette
with the body of a child, pierced through with swords. Terrors are vicious, cruel, cowardly,
and ultraviolent.

Swords are the suit of intellect, challenge, and conflict, and The Terror is nurtured in the
hearts of Moon citizens who are too cowardly or dull to face their fears
or think through things, clearly, for themselves. Most of the Executare harbor The Terror;
if their host is killed or sufficiently provoked they will cut their way out of their flesh shells
to try to deal with the problem on their own.

## Chariot
Cmdr. Gerald Yacht, Commander-in-chief of the Executare.

A vain little dictator in a hoverchair.

He delivers speeches on the MUZ television system stoking fear, targeting ethnic groups,
kids' trends and non-Christian lifestyles as degeneracy wilting the roots of society
as we know it. He's consistently putting up impressive numbers of imprisonments and executions
 of whoever his current scapegoat is. He sees pedophiles and junkies wherever he looks.
