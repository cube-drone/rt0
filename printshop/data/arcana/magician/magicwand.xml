* Instead of playing a Page of Cups on Cups and Balls, you may play the Page of Wands:
   * While the Page of Wands is on Cups and Balls:
   * All Wands now count as the Magician, as well as counting as their original suit and value.
   * The first Wand played in this way is free, but for each subsequent Wand used in this way, take 1 Corruption Point.

"It's not the wand that's magic - the wand is nothing more than a prop to guide the eyes away from what's really happening.
    It's the magician who's magic."
