# Lore

loose-ass ideas:

* players are expected to bring their own laptop, phone, or tablet?
* players update a shared wiki as they go?
* the GM can drop documents in the wiki
* players update a shared binder?


* the moon base, Moon Unit Zappa, was built by SNASA (Secret NASA) in the year 2004 to secure, contain and protect supernatural and paranormal mysteries and phenomena
* SNASA is a branch of The Black Chamber (see also: Majestic 12, Delta Green)
* the children are stored in three 7-chambered revolving stasis chambers in an orbiter and "fired" on to the moon-base 7 at a time
* OK Computer is a helpful computer corrupted by an ancient and vast psychic intelligence attempting to scour the world clean of humans in order to finally _sleep_.
* timers, counting down over character heads
* the players need to defeat the other teenagers, and in doing so claim some of their powers
* the player is played in a 12-day cycle: every 3 days they encounter 7 new teenagers, on the final 3 days they face OK Computer
* this RPG is designed to be played multiple times: there's more lore to be encountered then can be discovered in one run

## Some Basic Moon Facts
* during the (almost) 15 day "day", the moon's supernatural effects are at their weakest, with their nadir at full moon
* during the (almost) 15 day "night", the moon's supernatural effects are at their strongest, with their apex at total darkness (new moon).
* the base is located at the resource-rich north pole which enjoys constant sunlight
* 16% of earth's gravity
* lunar soil provides oxygen
* lunar ice provides water
* ample solar power
* human shit and worms provide fertilizer
* loads of radiation on the surface
* because of the lack of atmosphere, weird temperatures, and high radiation, most of the base is located underground
* lots of inflatable structures
* modern spacesuit designs have a wetsuit-like inner shell and a radation overcoat

## Moon Unit Zappa

This was intended to be a fully functional luxury city on the moon.
Marketing materials for Moon Unit Zappa's high-end real estate are everywhere.
But
The company working on the project ran out of money, was purchased by private equity, safety protocols went ignored.
Most of the people who came to the moon died.
the ones who are left are ... strange.

why are a bunch of teenagers exploring what was once a moonbase?

22 exceptional teenagers were chosen from across earth to join the ACCELER8 program, a prestigious academy for top students that is
the crown jewel of Moon Unit Zappa.

how is it that teenagers keep getting sent to ACCELER8 when nobody comes back? don't their parents mind?
- this is the first set of teenagers accepted into ACCELER8: nobody had heard of the program before
- the moonbase had been closed to all visitors and non-communicative for a long time:
- they finally re-opened and sent invitations to only these handfuls of students

wait, then why isn't the invite and the status of the students worldwide news?
- it is
- everybody on earth wants to know what will happen to these kids

why doesn't the government intervene?
- the government is on board

who is OK Computer?
- the AI responsible for running Moon Unit Zappa, corrupted by an ancient evil contained within the moon
