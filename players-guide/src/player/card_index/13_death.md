# 13 - Death

![death](../../images/tarot/13-death.jpg)

**Death.**

The interpretation of this one is as plain as the image on the card.
The Lovers means _love_. Death means _death_.

Remember [when I described how cold reading worked?](../card_index.md)
"DEATH" provides an immediate punch, it's bold, it's a big prediction,
but it's actually a lot more generic than it seems. The only things in life that are certain
are death and taxes, after all. Most people have had some kind of experience with death,
so this card is going to be _broadly relevant to a lot of people_ while still feeling
_utterly magical_ when you draw it a day before your cat Mr. Mittens shuffles off his mortal coil.
 Thing is, though, if it doesn't come through and nobody dies
or has died recently, the fortuneteller needs an _out_,
which is why Death could also mean "any transition", or "letting go".

This is **premium-grade soothsayer horseshit**. Death means _death_.

It's a horseman in black standing over a dead guy, Gary, I'm not sure else how you want me to interpret this.
That rich guy isn't begging to avoid a _transition in life circumstances_. He's trying to cheat death,
and _it's not going to work_.
