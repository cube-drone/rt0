[Magician Character Sheet](/generated/printables/magician.html)

## Description

A resourceful, powerful schemer, The Magician has brought a binder full of detailed plans
that has color-coded tabs for every possible situation and outcome. Sometimes magic is just
someone spending more time on something than anybody else might reasonably expect. They're always prepared,
and they always have a trick up their sleeve. The Magician gets access to more spells, and more damaging spells,
than any other Arcana.

* The Magician can treat The Fool card as a second The Magician card.
* The Magician gains the Clever ability.
* The Magician learns one extra spell at the start of the game.
* Choose two of the The Magician's Arcana Abilities.

### Skill: This Was All Part of My Plan
Once per Day, The Magician can have planned ahead, retroactively.

#### Planned Ahead, Retroactively?
* This means that The Magician can declare that they had a plan in place for a situation that has just arisen, and that they have already taken steps to prepare for it.
* This can include lots of things: having a piece of vital equipment on hand, or having bribed someone in advance.
* The GM can veto or negotiate this.

## Arcana Abilities

### Rabbit Out of a Hat
_A trick isn't that impressive on it's own: line up a few in a row, though, and you've got a show._

_Corruption Upgrade: Saw In Half_

* In order to activate Rabbit Out of a Hat, one card of each suit must be played.
* The suit of Major Arcana cards is "Major" and also must be included.
* Cards sitting on Rabbit Out of a Hat remain there.

    * Discard the Minor Arcana from Rabbit Out of a Hat.
    * Draw the remaining card from Rabbit Out of a Hat into hand: treat it as a Magician for the remainder of the turn.

### Saw in Half
_For the big finale, you're going to need a volunteer._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Saw in Half to Unlock it.**

* Take 1 Corruption Point:
   * For the remainder of combat, when a card is on Pull a Rabbit Out of a Hat, you may still use Defend.

* If the card drawn in this way is a Tower, take 1 Corruption Point and

### Cups and Balls
_No matter how hard they try to hit you, it seems like you're always one step ahead._

_Corruption Upgrade: Magic Wand_

* Place any Cup on Cups and Balls.
* While a Cup is on Cups and Balls:
   * All of your cards now count as Cups, as well as their original suit.
   * This includes Major Arcana: A Death, for example, counts as a "13 of Cups".
* Discard the card on Cups and Balls at will.

### Magic Wand
_"It's not the wand that's magic - the wand is nothing more than a prop to guide the eyes away from what's really happening.
    It's the magician who's magic."_

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Magic Wand to Unlock it.**

* You may also play a Wand on Cups and Balls.
* While a Wand is on Cups and Balls:
    * All cards now count as Wands, as well as their original suit.

### Three Card Monte
_Your nimble mind helps you rearrange your thoughts as easily as if they were cards._

_Corruption Upgrade: Is This Your Card_

* Place any "3" on Three Card Monte
* Draw three cards face-down from your deck. Hand them to the GM.
* The GM will show you one card, then mix it with the other two.
* Choose one of the three cards. If it is the card you saw, you may add it to your hand, treating it as a Magician.
* If it is not the card you saw, add it to your hand.
* Shuffle the other two cards back into your deck.

### Is This Your Card
_It's just a little sleight of hand._

**Corruption Upgrade: Mark 3 Corruption Points on Is This Your Card to Unlock it.**

* When Three Card Monte's effect triggers, after drawing the face-down cards, but before the GM shows you one:
   * You may guess which card is the one that will be revealed.
   * If you are correct, you do not need to play the game: the card is immediately added to your hand, treating it as a Magician.
   * If you are incorrect, the game proceeds as normal, but if you lose AND the card you guessed is not one of the three cards, take 1 Corruption Point.

### Disappearing Act
_Poof._

_Corruption Upgrade: Smoke and Mirrors_

* Place The Moon or The Devil on Disappearing Act.
* If there is a card on Disappearing Act, the next time you would take damage, instead
   * Discard a card from Disappearing Act.
