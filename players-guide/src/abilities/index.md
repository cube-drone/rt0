### Unbelievably Shitty Improvised Weapon
Place Minor Arcana cards of suit Wands or Swords on Strike.

Cards sitting on Strike remain there.
When the sum of the numerical values on the cards reaches (or exceeds) 13, discard all cards on Strike and deal 5 damage.

If Strong, 7 damage.
If Weak, 3 damage.
